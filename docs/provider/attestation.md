# Reaching and keeping `hardware` trust

> Last updated: 2026-10-10

How to check provider verification and retain legacy `hardware` trust where
eligible. New providers require macOS 27 or later and current qualified App
Attest authorization; a `hardware` label is not required for that path. Only
the frozen linked account/SE-key/previously MDM-verified device cohort may
temporarily use legacy verification. For operators; the
mechanism — what each layer proves, the grant and loss conditions, the routing
gate, and the code map — is in
[`../architecture/security/attestation.md`](../architecture/security/attestation.md)
and is not restated here.

Optional [App Attest shadow checks](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md) run in the background. Shadow results do not change these enrollment requirements or your existing trust eligibility. Version/cohort controls protect older clients; see the [rollout procedure](../operations/app-attest-rollout.md).

A signed version must be [qualified by the coordinator](../reference/provider-authorization.md#durable-build-qualification) before publication. Build approvals persist across coordinator restarts. Missing approval keeps App Attest-only serving pending; it does not require deleting your credentials or replacing an existing employer profile.

Account erasure also clears delayed account-specific proof writes and frozen
legacy-MDM membership; [shared-device cleanup](../architecture/account-erasure.md#shared-machines-and-shared-keys)
retains another live account's device evidence. Unshared APNs tokens and pending
challenges are removed from the coordinator's runtime cache too; stale replies
cannot restore them ([identity cleanup](../architecture/security/identity-binding.md#account-erasure-and-apns-runtime-state)).

Autopilot earnings-floor qualification is a separate historical check: a new
authorization does not qualify a declaration received before that grant. See
the [reward policy](../reference/pricing-model.md#autopilot-rewards).

## Read current verification in the dashboard

Open a machine's verification panel to inspect the coordinator's separate App
Attest and legacy decisions, verification times and authorization deadlines.
Green requires a current server verdict; expired, revoked, unsupported, offline
and stale/missing states do not manufacture a current grant from saved hardware
trust. App Attest-only machines retain their legacy `self_signed` field. A
provider advertising an App Attest protocol other than version 3 displays
`unsupported`, even if its reported OS supports App Attest.

The footer counts the union once and reports both method counts and overlap.
Offline machine records stay in the owned-machine denominator but not current
authorization. Public proof views omit raw certificates, receipt blobs and
credential identifiers. See [consumer verification](../consumer/verification.md)
and the [wire contract](../reference/api-contracts.md#verification-presentation-contract).


## App Attest without Darkbloom MDM

A failed initial enrollment can leave an Apple key unusable even when its identifier is still in Keychain. Darkbloom replaces that identifier after non-service-unavailable failures or interrupted attempts, subject to the persisted one-hour replacement cooldown and shared hourly generation budget. Service-unavailable failures keep the same key, and already saved enrollment proofs are retained for retry. Do not delete account, machine, Keychain or employer-management state to force retries. This recovery is not proof that the Mac is authorized; check the coordinator verdict before removing Darkbloom MDM. See the [key lifecycle](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#bounds-and-credential-lifecycle).

After a macOS upgrade, the running signed app checks App Attest again on its next coordinator connection. If a completed Apple callback reports key-generation failure without a usable ID, Darkbloom can retry after one minute within its persisted hourly budget; timeout, cancellation and busy admission retain the safer one-hour cooldown. A definite Apple service-unavailable assertion gets one local retry using the same key and challenge. These attempts cannot grant access without Apple's verified proof and the coordinator's current receipt, build and security checks.


If Apple's API returns a generic error during setup, the coordinator retries after one minute, then five minutes, then every ten minutes while the provider stays connected. Retrying cannot approve the machine without a successful qualified proof. Persistent generic errors can still require a signed provider update and diagnosis from the bounded native Apple error code; `darkbloom status` or `darkbloom doctor` reports current authorization. The [recovery policy](../reference/provider-authorization.md#controls) does not require deleting credentials or management profiles.

When the coordinator asks the provider to enroll a key that this Mac already enrolled, the provider clears that key and answers `key_unregistered`; the next exchange generates a replacement within the one-hour cooldown and shared hourly generation budget. The replacement goes through the full enrollment checks. Do not delete the Keychain item yourself.

`darkbloom doctor` shows the provider's local App Attest state in the `APP ATTEST` section: whether a key is stored and enrolled, any remaining key-generation cooldown, whether the provider runs in the logged-in GUI session, and a stalled Apple call. The daemon records this on each coordinator App Attest exchange (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Diagnostics/AppAttestLocalDiagnosis.swift`). If Apple reports App Attest as unsupported (`is_supported_false`), log in at the console and run `darkbloom restart` so the provider runs inside the GUI session, and confirm SIP is enabled and Startup Security Utility is set to Full Security.

Local key/history observations refresh after every proof exchange, including repeated assertions without another `prepare`. `doctor` and `report` advance displayed ages between exchanges while retaining the original observation metadata.

Each `ready` reply carries bounded diagnostics about process start and previous exit, console-user presence, SIP/authenticated root, signing preflight, key history and APNs push history. Failed attestation/assertion replies can additionally carry the native NSError chain. These optional fields are outside the signed transcript and never used for authorization. [`app-attest-shadow.md`](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md) defines them. `darkbloom doctor` explains the available observations with targeted advice ([doctor checks](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks)):

- `gui session`: a user is logged in, but the provider runs outside that session. Run `darkbloom restart` from the desktop session.
- `boot security` / `app signing`: Apple needs Full Security and an intact signed install. Known-invalid checks call for repair in Recovery or reinstallation. Missing signing data or unknown profile expiry produces an indeterminate warning, not a pass.
- `key history` / `last apple failure`: repeated `invalidKey` on brand-new keys, or a CryptoTokenKit `-3` key loss after a restart.

For the last two, run `darkbloom report` from an administrator account; macOS lets only administrator accounts read the system log. Use `sudo darkbloom report` instead if this account is allowed to use sudo. The report adds device-wide `devicecheckd` observations reduced to closed failure patterns and numeric codes. They can originate from other apps and are not attributable to Darkbloom, so they do not independently diagnose this provider's key. System-log evidence is never collected or sent automatically.

If an Apple DeviceCheck call never answers, every later App Attest call answers `busy` until the provider process restarts. The provider reports the stall and restarts itself through the normal drain when it is idle; the thresholds and limits are in the [App Attest reference](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#bounds-and-credential-lifecycle). The log line starts with `App Attest: Apple operation stalled`. Run `darkbloom restart` to recover immediately.

After first enrollment, Apple may provide a receipt that is not yet a verified risk receipt or lacks its risk metric. The coordinator keeps the connection pending and requests another signed assertion after one minute, five minutes, then at the normal ten-minute interval while receipt renewal completes. Continue checking `darkbloom status`; the absence of a verified risk metric cannot be treated as approval.

A verified assertion is one step toward authorization. Current serving also
requires the complete proof archive, the same authenticated account and
machine identity on this connection, a qualified signed build and the current
runtime checks. A transient identity or storage refusal remains pending; the
coordinator requests another fresh assertion on its bounded retry schedule.
Keep the provider running and inspect the current authorization reported by
`darkbloom status` or `darkbloom doctor`. A historical `eligible` observation
cannot authorize serving or MDM removal by itself. A missing or mismatched
Apple code measurement remains ineligible until an exact signed build is
qualified; do not delete a working credential to bypass that check.

New setup on macOS 27 or later skips MDM profile download in both the installer and `darkbloom enroll`. Darkbloom MDM will be deactivated soon; upgrade to macOS 27 to avoid legacy enrollment. A qualified macOS 27 provider can use [App Attest authorization](../reference/provider-authorization.md) when the coordinator explicitly enables it. Start the signed provider and check `darkbloom status` / `darkbloom doctor` for current App Attest authorization. Company-managed Macs keep their employer profile; they do not enroll into Darkbloom MDM for this path.

When `darkbloom status` or `darkbloom doctor` says App Attest authorizes the connection but MDM removal needs fresh coordinator readiness, keep existing profiles installed and wait for a fresh decision. The displayed serving lease can remain valid after removal readiness becomes stale. Both doctor summaries and status use the separate decisions in `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Diagnostics/ProviderAuthorizationReadiness.swift` (`summary`); see the [authorization reference](../reference/provider-authorization.md).

After the coordinator enables removal and reports readiness, run `darkbloom unenroll` and choose the App Attest option. Removal guidance requires a coordinator decision received within the last 10 seconds, as well as a current daemon snapshot and unexpired authorization; a local state-file rewrite cannot extend readiness. It requires macOS 27 or later; `--keep-serving` remains a direct shortcut. The command preserves credentials/account data, validates the exact Darkbloom enrollment and guides removal in System Settings. If the read-only administrator inventory is needed, run the command in the foreground of an interactive terminal: `sudo` reads the password with terminal echo disabled. Refusing authentication, running without a terminal, or running as a background job withholds guidance; no profile is removed by the CLI. The full-exit option stops the provider and offers identity cleanup, so choose App Attest to retain provider identity.

New setup remains pending if App Attest is unavailable or unqualified; diagnose
with `darkbloom doctor` instead of installing an MDM profile. Under the upcoming
policy, the legacy steps below apply only to frozen identities, not to every
older-macOS machine or existing local enrollment.

## Existing machines and upgrade notices

Under the upcoming [frozen legacy policy](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#frozen-legacy-authorization-cohort), only already successfully MDM-verified
devices whose stored account, SE key and serial enter the durable cohort
continue through legacy verification. The first upgraded production coordinator
startup drains eligible historical inventory after revocation replay before
freezing. Soft-deleted accounts and provider records cannot qualify for that
initial snapshot; see the [cohort qualification rules](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#frozen-legacy-authorization-cohort). A restart, a new account, a new device or a new
account association does not reopen eligibility. Reenrollment requires the
existing key under its frozen account and the [authenticated signed enrollment
request](../reference/api-contracts.md#legacy-mdm-enrollment-proof). Preserve your
key and account; a replacement identity must use qualified App Attest, with no
unsupported-OS fallback. Lost or hashless historical evidence may conservatively
omit a device; a previous local profile alone does not establish eligibility.
Current verification still requires the validated account, same frozen SE key
and prior successful MDM evidence. See the
[historical evidence and backfill limits](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#frozen-legacy-authorization-cohort);
recent/open sessions or incomplete history are not guaranteed to be recovered.
`darkbloom enroll` checks the authenticated signed request with the coordinator
even when a Darkbloom profile is already installed. Only a successful eligibility
check returns "Already enrolled", without saving or reinstalling a profile;
this is not a fresh serving grant. No grace period has been chosen and no expiry
is implemented.

Grandfathered legacy MDM-only serving does not qualify your Mac for base rewards.
Base rewards require macOS 27 or later and current qualified App Attest
authorization for every provider, old or new, including when the Mac also
retains MDM evidence. The OS claim must be bound to that same authorization;
missing, malformed or older versions do not qualify. Existing economics guards
still apply.
Inference/work earnings are unchanged, with no retroactive clawback of rewards.
See [billing](../consumer/billing.md) for the reward policy.

Upgrading macOS does not uninstall MDM. After upgrading to macOS 27
and updating the provider, restart it and check `darkbloom status`; remove only
the Darkbloom profile through the approved `darkbloom unenroll` App Attest path.
Keep employer management installed.

Every command in the updated CLI warns on stderr when the local OS is below
27. The setup page and dashboard also show the transition notice; machine
warnings use current/last reported OS versions, with missing reports labelled
unknown. The notice does not enact a retirement deadline; the cohort restriction
is a separate coordinator gate. Older installed binaries receive the CLI notice
only after updating.

## Prerequisites

- A supported Apple silicon Mac with SIP on and Secure Boot at **Full
  Security**, running the provider ([`installation.md`](./installation.md),
  [`hardware-requirements.md`](./hardware-requirements.md)). Both settings are
  changed only in Recovery; the coordinator checks them independently of your
  self-report ([Layer 3](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-3--mdm-securityinfo-the-hardware-grant)).
- For the legacy path below, the Mac must not be enrolled in another MDM. `darkbloom enroll` refuses
  (`managedByOtherMDM`) and `darkbloom doctor` reports "enrolled in another
  MDM … hardware trust unavailable on this Mac"
  ([`../architecture/security/enrollment.md#failure-modes`](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#failure-modes)).
- Under the upcoming policy, the legacy steps below are for a frozen identity
  only, not new onboarding on older macOS. Use the linked provider account and
  existing SE key; new identities need qualified App Attest.
- A real console user logged in (Aqua session), automatic login enabled,
  auto-logout on idle disabled, and sleep prevented. APNs registration, which
  the code-identity flag depends on, only works inside a logged-in GUI session;
  `darkbloom doctor` reports these as `console session`, `automatic login`,
  `auto-logout on idle` and `sleep prevention`
  ([`troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks`](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks)).
- A healthy `darkbloom start`. Registration with a valid Secure-Enclave-signed
  blob grants `self_signed` at once ([Layer 1](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-1--secure-enclave-registration-blob));
  `hardware` is only ever granted on top of that.

## Steps

### 1. Enrol the Mac

```bash
darkbloom enroll
```

For a frozen identity, the command downloads the enrolment profile from
`POST /v1/enroll` using linked provider credentials and a fresh SE-key proof,
saves it as `Darkbloom-Enroll-<uuid>.mobileconfig`, registers it with System Settings and
opens the Profiles pane (`EnrollCommand.swift`; options in
[`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#darkbloom-enroll--darkbloom-unenroll)).
"Already enrolled" means the Darkbloom profile is present and you can skip to
step 3. What the profile contains and the read-only `AccessRights` it requests
are in [`../architecture/security/enrollment.md#the-profile`](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#the-profile).

### 2. Approve the profile

In **System Settings → General → Device Management**, select *Darkbloom
Provider Enrollment*, click **Install**, and authenticate. `mdmclient` then
performs SCEP and the MDM check-in against the coordinator's MicroMDM
([operator flow](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#operator-flow)). If the
profile is shown as unverified, the coordinator served it unsigned; installing
it is still safe because signing is install-time UX only
([profile signing](../architecture/security/enrollment.md#profile-signing)).

### 3. Confirm your posture

The coordinator grants `hardware` when Apple's MDM subsystem on your Mac
reports SIP enabled and `SecureBootLevel` `full`, in agreement with your
attestation blob. Check both before waiting on the coordinator:

```bash
csrutil status            # System Integrity Protection status: enabled.
csrutil authenticated-root status
```

For Secure Boot, open **Startup Security Utility** in Recovery and confirm
**Full Security**. Fixing either setting requires a reboot into Recovery, which
also restarts the provider.

### 4. Wait for the verification, or re-check

Nothing more is needed from you: the coordinator's verification scheduler picks
up the enrolled device, sends a `SecurityInfo` command, and grants on the first
report that agrees with your blob. A transient outcome (device not found yet,
not enrolled, report timed out) leaves your level unchanged and is retried on
the scheduler's backoff; only a received report that **contradicts** your blob
demotes you ([Layer 3](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-3--mdm-securityinfo-the-hardware-grant),
[failure modes](../architecture/security/attestation.md#failure-modes)).

To re-check after fixing something, restart the provider so it re-registers:

```bash
darkbloom restart
darkbloom status
```

### Keeping the level

- **Stay online and awake.** Trust is per connection: a reconnect caps a
  stored `hardware` back to `self_signed`, and the coordinator restores it
  from durable device evidence on your first passing challenge only within the
  trust-reuse bounds; otherwise a fresh `SecurityInfo` round-trip runs
  (trust reuse in [Layer 3](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-3--mdm-securityinfo-the-hardware-grant)).
  Missing the periodic challenge deroutes you; the cadence, timeouts and strike
  counts are in [Layer 2](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-2--periodic-challenge).
- **Keep the console session.** `code_attested` is earned through an APNs push
  that only a logged-in Aqua session can receive; once the operator enables
  enforcement, un-attested providers receive no private text
  ([Flag — APNs code identity](../architecture/security/attestation.md#flag--apns-code-identity)).
- **Short coordinator reconnects.** A continuously code-verified process can resume through a fresh encrypted WebSocket challenge within the bounded [code-continuity window](../architecture/security/attestation.md#flag--apns-code-identity). Restarting the provider changes its process key; hardware continuity alone does not substitute for code identity.
- **Keep the same identity.** The Secure Enclave signing key is persistent in
  the keychain, so your SE public key survives restarts and is the identity the
  trust-reuse and code-identity caches are keyed on
  ([`../architecture/security/identity-binding.md`](../architecture/security/identity-binding.md)).
  If the keychain path fails — for example a binary without the
  `keychain-access-groups` entitlement — `ProviderLoop.swift` falls back to an
  ephemeral key with a warning, you appear as a brand-new identity, and you
  cannot rejoin the frozen legacy cohort; use qualified App Attest instead.
- **Run a released build.** Binary, metallib and model-hash drift against
  registration untrusts you; `darkbloom update` returns you to a build in the
  release record ([`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#darkbloom-update)).

## Verify

`darkbloom status` prints the last `trust_status` the coordinator sent as
`Trust: <level> / <status>` (`StatusCommand.swift`). What you want to see:

| `Trust:` line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hardware / online` with reason `MDM verification passed` or `MDM verification passed (late SecurityInfo)` | A fresh `SecurityInfo` grant on this connection |
| `hardware / online` with a trust-reuse reason (`same_binary`, `continuity`, `approved_release_transition`, `continuity_release_transition`) | Restored from durable device evidence after a reconnect |
| `self_signed / online`, reason `SE attestation verified, awaiting MDM verification` | Enrolment not complete or the report has not arrived yet — see Troubleshooting |
| any level `/ untrusted` with a failure reason | The coordinator stopped routing to you — see Troubleshooting |

The reason strings are listed in
[trust status messages](../architecture/security/attestation.md#trust-status-messages-to-providers).

`darkbloom doctor` shows the local side: MDM enrolment, SIP, the console-session
checks above, and (with `--support`) the coordinator URL and MDM state
([`troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks`](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks)).

Anyone can read your public verdict — `trust_level`, `mdm_verified`,
`mda_verified` and the verified posture fields, never your serial, UDID, APNs
token or `code_attested` — from `GET /v1/providers/attestation`; the fields are
explained in [`../consumer/verification.md#public-attestation-endpoint`](../consumer/verification.md#public-attestation-endpoint).

What `hardware` does not prove: it says nothing about *which* binary holds your
key (that is `code_attested`) or *which* Apple device (that is `mda_verified`;
Apple issues a fresh attestation only about once per device per week, so the
flag can lag the level — [Flag — Apple Managed Device Attestation](../architecture/security/attestation.md#flag--apple-managed-device-attestation)).
Neither flag changes the level. Single-node inference is the supported security
boundary: multi-node RDMA over Thunderbolt bypasses the in-process memory
protections and is not trusted. The process defences behind the privacy
capabilities the routing gate requires, and their known limits, are recorded in
[`../threat-model.yaml`](../threat-model.yaml) and summarised in
[`../architecture/components/provider.md#process-boundaries`](../architecture/components/provider.md#process-boundaries);
what the provider can and cannot see is in
[`../architecture/security/encryption.md#what-each-party-can-observe`](../architecture/security/encryption.md#what-each-party-can-observe).

## Troubleshooting

The provider's `status_signature` must cover the same canonical bytes the
coordinator reconstructs. `StatusCanonical.build` in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/AttestationBuilder.swift` matches
the coordinator's ordering of mixed-case `model_hashes` and `template_hashes`
keys and its escaping of U+2028/U+2029. This encoding correction leaves
enrolment, signature verification and trust requirements unchanged; the byte
format and failure policy are in [Layer 2](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-2--periodic-challenge).

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `trust_level: self_signed` persists | MDM verification not completed, or identity excluded from frozen cohort | For a frozen identity, reenroll with linked credentials and signed proof; for a new identity, use qualified App Attest and inspect its separate coordinator verdict |
| `mdm_verified: false` | Not enrolled, or `SecurityInfo` timed out | Confirm enrolment; wait for the next retry on the [scheduler backoff](../architecture/security/attestation.md#layer-3--mdm-securityinfo-the-hardware-grant) |
| `mda_verified: false` while `hardware` | Apple has not issued a fresh attestation yet or the chain did not bind your SE key | Wait; informational only, routing is unaffected |
| `trust_status` reason `posture-mismatch` / status `untrusted` | MDM says SIP or Secure Boot differs from your blob | Fix the posture in Recovery (`csrutil enable`, Full Security), reboot, restart the provider |
| `code_attested` never passes | No Aqua session / no APNs token / pushes throttled | Log in at the console, enable automatic login, disable auto-logout; check `darkbloom doctor`; a reconnect soon after a proof uses the resume path instead of a push ([Flag — APNs code identity](../architecture/security/attestation.md#flag--apns-code-identity)) |
| Derouted after missed challenges | Sleep or network blip | Recovers on the next passing challenge; prevent sleep |
| `status signature verification failed` while the plain challenge signature passes | Invalid status signature or a mismatch between provider and coordinator canonical bytes | Run `darkbloom update` and `darkbloom restart`; if it persists, use the diagnostics below. The coordinator continues to reject mismatching signatures |
| Binary hash drift warning | Running a build not in the coordinator's release record | `darkbloom update` |
| `darkbloom enroll` says the Mac is managed by another MDM | Another MDM profile is installed | Remove it (System Settings → General → Device Management) or use another Mac; `hardware` is unavailable while it is present |
| Every flag lost after an update or reinstall | The Secure Enclave key fell back to ephemeral (warning in `darkbloom logs`) | Reinstall a signed release build so the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement is present |

For local diagnostics use `darkbloom doctor` and `darkbloom logs --last 1h`.
Provider logs are never uploaded automatically; `darkbloom report` uploads a
unified-log excerpt to `POST /v1/provider/log-report` only when you run it
(`--dry-run` prints it first; [`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#darkbloom-report)).
On macOS 27 the report also carries the App Attest snapshot and the APNs push
history. Run from an administrator account (or with `sudo` where allowed), it
also carries closed, device-wide `devicecheckd` pattern matches, not provider-specific proof.
