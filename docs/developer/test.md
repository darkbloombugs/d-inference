## Autopilot rewards

Run from the repository root with the pinned Go toolchain and an isolated local
`DATABASE_URL` whose role can create disposable test databases:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/payments/autopilotrewards -count=1
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/store/contracts ./coordinator/tests/store/postgres -run 'AutopilotRewards|AutopilotConsent|Migration|Migrate' -count=1
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/api/provider ./coordinator/tests/api/operations/contracts ./coordinator/tests/api ./coordinator/tests/registry -run 'AutopilotReward|AutopilotConsent' -count=1
go test ./coordinator/tests/protocol -run Autopilot -count=1
```

Without `DATABASE_URL`, the PostgreSQL cases skip; a memory-only pass is not
persistence validation. Never use a production DSN. The existing `testdb` fixtures
isolate databases and coordinate the local server's connection budget.

| Boundary | Regression owner |
|---|---|
| Once-rounded floor, UTC day guards and independent-day worker catch-up | `coordinator/tests/payments/autopilotrewards/engine_test.go` |
| Shared final day for early/late joiners, post-cutoff rejection and earlier pending-payment retries; fixture clocks remain inside the fixed campaign | `coordinator/tests/payments/autopilotrewards/engine_test.go`; `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/autopilot_rewards_cutoff_test.go` |
| Exact first-ever window, sponsored inference, whole first partial day, immutable baseline, history gaps, canonical aliases, per-day consent, pool retry and single-count earnings | `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/` (`autopilot_rewards_test.go`, `autopilot_rewards_history_test.go`, `autopilot_rewards_identity_test.go`) |
| Delayed cross-session consent and frozen-history conflicts without rewriting finalized receipts | `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/autopilot_rewards_history_test.go` (`TestAutopilotRewardsDelayedSessionConsentPreservesFirstOptIn`, `TestAutopilotRewardsLateEarlierConsentFlagsFrozenHistory`) |
| Migration/schema equivalence, restart persistence, concurrent cap/deduplication and rollback of all financial writes | `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/` (`autopilot_rewards_migration_test.go`, `autopilot_rewards_test.go`, `autopilot_rewards_atomicity_test.go`) |
| Concurrent independent consent journals, exclusive inventory exclusion, per-session ownership and session-local binding | `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/autopilot_consent_concurrency_test.go` |
| Authenticated original receive time, pre-binding journal, accepted heartbeat state, daily checkpoints and bounded failed-write queue | `coordinator/tests/api/provider/autopilot_rewards_test.go`, `autopilot_rewards_queue_test.go` in the same directory; `coordinator/tests/registry/autopilot_reward_snapshot_test.go` |
| Admin auth, exact money JSON, immutable backfill and independently default-off config | `coordinator/tests/api/operations/contracts/autopilot_rewards_test.go`; `coordinator/tests/api/autopilot_rewards_config_test.go` |

Run `make provider-test` for the Swift mirror with source-matched dependencies
and Metal library. `AutopilotSnapshotCodingTests`, `AutopilotInventoryTests`,
`ModelAutopilotTests` and `ModelAutopilotShadowTests` under
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Autopilot/` check optional saved-consent
encoding/decoding and independence from runtime readiness. Keep provider test
state isolated through the standard runner; do not overwrite a running daemon's
status files for a focused test. These tests do not prove production rollout or
the truth of an operator's imported historical evidence. See
[reward operations](../operations/autopilot-rewards.md).

## SSD reconciliation and tracked-native retry regressions

`SSDCheckpointMaintenanceEpochTests` covers an externally missing oldest entry
whose accounting alone satisfies the limit, and a leased same-tag rewrite whose
fresh publication remains indexed and readable. Both use actual encrypted files.
`SSDTrackedNativeRetryTests` uses the real `EngineV2.planCompleteCheckpointImport`
binding, reservation pressure and a delayed native retirement fence to prove that
host refund cannot rearm a shorter AR allocation. Its tiny native graph is not a
trained MiMo model or numerical qualification. Run these rebuilt suites under the
exclusive native lane with the normal resource safeguards; keep the broader
shorter-checkpoint, native-block, epoch-recovery and write-budget regressions.

## SSD epoch status lookup and retirement snapshots

Run the rebuilt provider's `SSDCacheEpochStoreRecoveryTests` with
`scripts/run-nested-suite.sh` and Swift Testing enabled. The non-root permission
regression exercises both failed parent-directory opens and failed status
lookups, verifies refused retirement/rotation/sequence operations, and then
requires the same store to recover without changing its persisted epoch.
Existing missing, substituted and malformed record cases retain their refusal
and ownership-revocation checks.

Run `go test ./e2e -run '^TestConnectedRetirementObservationRejectsIdentityReplacement$'`
for the retirement snapshot oracle. This test rejects delayed evictions after
provider, model or epoch replacement. The connected live fixture also compares
the original capability when eviction is first observed and after refreshing
the report; it still requires its ordinary model, host and disk admission gates.
## Autopilot machine cohorts

Run the focused coordinator and isolated harness suites with the pinned Go
toolchain:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/registry/... -run 'Test(Autopilot|ModelAutopilot)' -count=1
go test ./coordinator/tests/api/operations/contracts -run Autopilot -count=1
go test ./coordinator/tests/store/... -run 'MachineAutopilot|Migration|Migrate' -count=1
go test ./e2e/testbed -count=1
go test ./e2e -run '^$'
```

`coordinator/tests/registry/autopilot_machine_cohort_test.go`,
`autopilot_machine_lease_test.go` and `autopilot_machine_donors_test.go` in the
same directory cover exact machine selection, mixed-mode isolation, reconnects,
identity changes and actual donor protection. Existing consent, inventory,
memory, writer, uncertain-command and terminal-reconciliation tests remain part
of the focused selector.

`coordinator/tests/registry/autopilot_machine_policy_time_test.go` uses virtual
time and real memory-store callbacks to cross the freshness boundary during a
successful policy read or between durable deliveries. It keeps fresh and exact
boundary positive controls, rejects old buffered tick timestamps, and preserves
future evaluation epochs without changing production thresholds.

Machine-setting contracts exercise real memory/Postgres stores, canonical merges,
idempotent revisions and the cached-store wrapper. PostgreSQL tests require a
disposable local `DATABASE_URL`; `testdb.Main` isolates each process's database.
Without that variable, PostgreSQL coverage skips. Migration checks cover fresh
and legacy schemas, preserved settings on replay, constraints and reopening a
store without truncating its data. HTTP tests use the composed authenticated
router for desired-mode edits, paging, errors and effective-session projection.

`e2e/testbed/autopilot_cohort_test.go` uses real registry operations to check
that fixture identities bind only to running suite-owned authenticated accounts.
It creates real inventory/settings rows while seeding trusted account/launch
outcomes rather than proving Apple attestation.
The real-provider `TestIntegration_AutopilotCachedBootstrapAndPause` additionally
requires a cached model and isolated Postgres; it checks live acknowledgement,
cached loading, inference, persisted endpoint demotion/re-enable, a fresh
acknowledgement after re-enable, and pause without rewriting desired mode.
Compiling it is not running it. Neither the
unit fixture nor that bootstrap case establishes live replacement quality,
hardware identity proof or production improvement.

## SSD write endurance

Run `bash scripts/test-ssd-write-budget.sh` on macOS with Xcode to exercise the
unchanged production accounting sources without building MLX. It covers an
accelerated full day, hourly cache reconstruction, concurrent accounting,
separate-process persistence, clock rollback and damaged/unsafe ledger files.
Only small temporary accounting files are written; no model, provider process,
production cache or credentials are used. This focused check does not replace
the full `ProviderCoreTests` integration suites, including `SSDBlockStreamingTests`
and `LaunchAgentPathsAndErrorsTests`.

## Pull-request restacking

Run `python3 scripts/test-restack-after-squash.py` for the regression suite of
`scripts/restack-after-squash.py`. Follow the [stacking guide](pull-requests.md)
for the live `--check` before an authorized `--push`; local tests do not replace
checking the actual squash, current remote refs, Verified signatures, CI,
mergeability, and approvals after an update.

## Nightly Linear package

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s automations/nightly-linear/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

`automations/nightly-linear/tests/test_refresh.py` (`RefreshTests`) exercises the
same updater command used by the launcher against temporary local Git repos.
It checks fetching one consistent revision, repeat runs, real package loading,
document links, and preservation after dirty or divergent checkouts, wrong
origins, unmanaged clones, failed fetches, or missing required skills.
The tests make no GitHub or Linear requests. The scoped
`.github/workflows/nightly-linear-package.yml` runs the same command.

Live onboarding, connector permissions, unattended execution, and duplicate-free
Linear updates require the teammate pilot described in the
[package rollout procedure](../../automations/nightly-linear/README.md#verification-and-rollout).
Offline updater tests do not verify those outcomes.

## Reservation storage and scan benchmarks

Registry regression tests in `coordinator/tests/registry/candidate_storage_test.go`
and `reservation_storage_test.go` cover high-water reference clearing, separate
scan passes, retained public/decorated candidates and plans, and scans at and
above the bounded private storage cutoff. `pending_snapshot_test.go` checks
report ownership/validation boundaries and pending work beyond the inline
buffer, including content commitment and exact memory retirement. Selection
regressions in `coordinator/tests/registry/selection/` compare alternate order
and random draw traces against successive calls to the production selector.

Run `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/registry/...` with the repository's pinned
Go version. Freeze time through `testing/synctest` for retained-quote comparisons;
wall-clock forecast ages are part of the quote contract. Fixtures bind only
isolated localhost endpoints and need no production credentials.

For timing, build identical benchmark harnesses on both revisions first, then
run their prebuilt test binaries sequentially in fresh processes. Interleave
revision order across at least six rounds, fix `GOMAXPROCS`, and keep other builds
and tests idle. `BenchmarkReservationScale` covers 32–6,000 providers and two or
fifteen models; the 3,000/two-model and larger cutoff cases guard pool economics.
`BenchmarkReserveProviderExPendingService_350x2` adds exact reported/local lease
overlap and zero, four or sixteen pending owners. Atomic request IDs in the
parallel reservation benchmarks prevent worker debits from colliding. Parallel
ns/op measures aggregate throughput, while writer wait maxima are noisy local
observations; neither is production inference latency. See
[the October 4 measurement record](../reports/2026-10-04-registry-scan-optimization.md).

## Component CI routing

CI and Integration Tests stop superseded PR runs without cancelling independent
default-branch pushes. Routing regressions pin both concurrency policies.
Cancellation is not a passing test result or an intentional component skip.

The ordinary provider `Run Swift tests` step invokes the unchanged
`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` through `scripts/run-provider-test-watchdog.py`.
After 480 seconds it captures process diagnostics; at 900 seconds it terminates
owned test processes and exits 124. A 20-minute outer step timeout allows time
for diagnostics and cleanup. Failure does not suppress later isolated native
gates; cancellation does. Non-cancelled attempts upload the transcript, result
and available stack samples as `provider-test-diagnostics` for seven days.
Run `python3 scripts/test-provider-test-watchdog.py` for real subprocess exit,
deadline and cancellation regressions. `scripts/test-provider-ci-workflow.py`
pins the watchdog wiring; `scripts/test-integration-ci-workflow.py` checks cache
wiring while retaining all E2E gates, and `scripts/test-provider-ci-cache.py`
checks integration/provider/release cache isolation and compatibility boundaries.

Run `python3 scripts/test-integration-ci-workflow.py` to check those integration
invariants offline. The command assertion accepts the original E2E commands or
the exact additive `-cover -covermode=set -coverpkg="$E2E_COVER_PKG"` bundle with
`-args -test.gocoverdir="$covdir"`. Negative cases reject missing or changed test
selectors, skip patterns, counts, timeouts and parallelism; the workflow checks
still require all three unconditional gates and their backend environment values.

Run `python3 scripts/test-ci-component-paths.py` for offline component-routing
regressions. It creates real temporary Git repositories to check PR merge-base
comparison, multiple commits, more than 300 changed files, additions, deletions,
both rename paths, newline-bearing filenames, SDK gitlink updates, push SHAs,
zero-before fallback and manual runs. Invalid or unavailable revisions must fail
without emitting skip outputs. No production credentials or model weights are used.

The same suite pins workflow dependency/condition wiring and exhaustively executes
the `Provider Tests` aggregate shell against detector and lane results. Only a
successful detector plus three successful selected lanes, or three intentionally
skipped irrelevant lanes, passes. Failure, cancellation, unexpected skips and
missing detector outputs fail. `scripts/test-provider-ci-workflow.py` retains its
independent suite/build prerequisite checks. Release Integrity runs both offline
suites even for docs-only PRs. See [build routing](build.md) for dependencies and
default-branch behavior. Relevant E2E benchmarks still require the existing
`benchmarks` environment approval; irrelevant PRs do not request that approval.

Docs Impact checks out the PR head and compares it with the merge base of the
event's base SHA, not GitHub's synthetic merge commit. Upstream changes present
only in that merge therefore do not create documentation requirements for the PR;
the canonical source-to-document rules still apply to every changed PR path.

The documentation-impact guards (`scripts/test-docs-impact-check.py`) exercise
both production components and their adapters after package moves. Billing API
and inference settlement owners require billing documentation; inference demand
capture requires Autopilot documentation; inference and provider verification
metric emitters require telemetry documentation; registry eligibility, gates,
queue assignments, queue-drain admission and candidate/quote plans require
routing or scheduling documentation. Release artifact metadata validation
requires API-contract documentation as well as the release runbook. The guards
supply every unrelated canonical document to ensure ownership or API-contract
updates cannot satisfy another domain's requirement, then verify each permitted
domain document satisfies it. Go test files remain excluded from these rules.
The soft-delete rule separately requires `docs/reference/soft-delete.md` for
the current live-row readers and writers, including small-model contact exports
and initial legacy MDM cohort qualification; the cohort owners also retain their
trust-documentation requirement. sqlc sources still require their
canonical generation/type docs too. New reader/writer paths must extend the
rule. The tests cover both backends, generated queries, unrelated history
files, test exclusions and the maintainer override.
`coordinator/tests/store/contracts/soft_delete_domain_reads_test.go` exercises
contact filtering before pagination and cohort evidence filtering in memory and
isolated PostgreSQL, including repeated reads of a frozen cohort.
Shared fixtures in `coordinator/tests/protocol/testdata/` retain the protocol
documentation requirement because they define cross-language wire examples.

The provider test runner isolates daemon-state and loaded-model snapshots in a
temporary directory for each run. Unit-test providers must not overwrite the
operator’s live status or recovery evidence (`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh`).

The `d-inference` macOS CI lanes pin `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-27` and select
Xcode 27 / native SwiftPM before compilation. Unit, SDK, prompt-parity,
integration and benchmark commands and their existing approval gates are
preserved. The older-OS signed-artifact smoke alone uses Blacksmith macOS 26.
The signing validation and benchmark jobs provision GitHub CLI explicitly
before their first `gh` command; see `scripts/install-macos-github-cli.sh`.
See [runner setup and cache isolation](build.md#sdk-27-release-builds-and-caches).

How to run the unit tests for each component, the end-to-end suite that boots a
real coordinator + Swift provider against ephemeral Postgres, and the docs
lint — and which CI workflow runs what. `make test` runs every unit suite plus
the docs lint locally; CI runs a subset per pull request (see the CI workflow
map: the Gemma benchmark-wrapper tests run only locally). The e2e suite needs an Apple Silicon
Mac with the test checkpoints cached.

The registry's `TestCacheAttemptBudget*` tests cover logical byte charging,
checked arithmetic, exact-edge admission, immutable replacement/refunds and
detached tracker storage. `TestCacheAttemptBudgetReclaimsFinishedRecordsBeforeRefusing`
and `TestCacheAttemptBudgetRefusesWhenInFlightRecordsFillIt` check that a full
budget gives a new request the earliest-expiring finished record's bytes but
never an in-flight record's, and the status counters. The
`TestCacheAttemptPressure*` controls and `TestIndependentTerminalGracePressure`
exercise terminal-only reclamation, live-budget refusal, the 64-record work
bound, terminal idempotence, late-READY rejection, immutable charges and both
expiry orders. `TestCacheAttemptTrackedHashBytesStayWithinLogicalBudget`
uses 137 attempts with 3,906 valid boundaries each to distinguish byte-bounded
admission from the old count-only tracker; it allocates no model or million-token
prompt. Run these with `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/registry -run
'^(TestCacheAttempt(Budget|TrackedHash|Nonce|Pressure)|TestIndependentTerminalGracePressure)' -count=1`,
together with the existing cache preparation, ownership,
capability-generation and accepted-write cutoff regressions. Byte refusal must
remain nil-error cold inference, with no cache metadata or calibration exclusion.
These are logical state/ownership tests, not physical-memory measurements,
native SSD hit-rate benchmarks or hosted certification.

`TestPlanningClientTracksConfiguredWorkers`, `TestPlanAdmission*`,
`TestPlannerBurstWaitsForWorkersWithoutBlockingHealth` and
`TestQueuedPlanCancellationNeverReachesSidecar` check configured capacity,
bounded pending bytes/counts, exact 40-request bursts, health/control isolation,
cancellation, deadlines and recovery. Run `go test -race ./tests/promptcontract ./tests/registry`
from `coordinator`. `TestDiagnosticFortyQPSPlanningCeiling` retains the unchanged
registry rate ceiling as a diagnostic, not an SSD hit-rate benchmark.

Run `TestPlanningConnectionBudget`,
`TestControlReconnectsDuringPlanningSaturation` and
`TestControlTrafficAtConfiguredWorkerCapacity` to cover lifetime connection
headroom, nondefault worker/connection limits, fresh and reconnected health/control
traffic under saturation, invalid-budget refusal and admission refunds. These
use the actual Go HTTP transports and a synthetic Unix listener mirroring the
Rust connection semaphore; they do not replace the real-sidecar opt-in below.

`TestPlannerRealSidecarAdmission` is an additional CPU-only opt-in: set
`DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR` to a source-bound local release binary and
`DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_CONTRACTS` to verified Bonsai/Qwen4 contract directories,
then run `go test ./tests/promptcontract -run TestPlannerRealSidecarAdmission -count=1 -v`.
It checks 720 plans against warm exact references through 64K tokens with the
unchanged one-second timeout. It does not load model weights or measure SSD hits.
See [the diagnostic report](../reports/2026-09-24-cache-planner-admission.md) for evidence and limits.
`TestDiagnosticCacheEpochFanout` exercises coordinator-wide holder withdrawal
for one model epoch (`go test ./tests/registry -run TestDiagnosticCacheEpochFanout`
from `coordinator`; repeat with `-race`).
`SSDCheckpointPublicationCPUTests` binds tiny CPU tensors and checks
native encrypted-store publication preservation plus successful survivor restoration.
After the normal Swift test build and MLX resource setup, run
`swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing --filter SSDCheckpointPublicationCPUTests`
from `provider-swift`. `SSDOwnedEntryRetirementTests` covers survivor bytes,
durable epoch/sequence, foreign paths, missing/symlinked files and invalid epoch
records. The wider SSD suites retain corruption, read coordination, cancellation,
write recovery and destructive invalidation controls.

`SSDCheckpointCommitRetirementTests` pauses actual encrypted writers after
rename or duplicate authentication, runs active-owner whole-root eviction with
newer inactive-root bytes, reconciles, then requires a readable committed file
and READY publication. It also covers attention write-behind, unrelated
survivors, post-commit self-eviction without READY and queued-writer cancellation.
`SSDCheckpointFileCoordinatorTests` checks nonblocking maintenance, FIFO/read
ownership and cleanup; `SSDOwnedEntryRetirementTests` checks busy-entry skipping
alongside no-follow and epoch fences. Build the exact source and matched MLX
resources before selecting these suites. Do not reuse a predecessor binary.
`SSDCheckpointCPUAcceptanceTests` replays the existing complete lifecycle,
duplicate/corruption, shared-ownership and telemetry oracles under an explicitly
checked CPU device. It preserves their assertions, including paged and contiguous
geometry, actual backing ownership and refusal-before-read controls. Run the
CPU storage selection from `provider-swift` after building and staging resources:

```bash
swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing --no-parallel \
  --filter 'SSDCheckpointCPUAcceptanceTests|SSDCheckpointCommitRetirementTests|SSDOwnedEntryRetirementTests|SSDCheckpointFileCoordinatorTests|SSDCheckpointFileCoordinatorPathTests|SSDCacheEpochStoreTests|SSDCheckpointPublicationCPUTests|SSDNoFollowIOSpecialFileTests|SSDTestDirectoryTests'
```

Native complete-checkpoint fixtures materialize their synthetic model/scalar parameters before either comparison arm and join donation writers before asserting reservation cleanup. Their bitwise state and continuation checks remain exact.

`SSDShorterNativeBlockRestoreTests` and `SSDNativeCheckpointOracleTests` each run
in a mandatory fresh process through `scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` and the
nonempty/no-skip wrapper. Swift's task-local CPU selection does not change the
native default-stream key used by MLX's per-thread compiled-function cache. A
prior GPU trace can therefore contaminate a later CPU recomputation after an
executor hop. These CPU tests must not share that trace history with GPU suites.
The shorter-restore test retains its exact cold-state and suffix assertions and
also compares the actual donor's host byte copies with authenticated SSD bytes
and adopted state. The no-SSD controls compare the same frozen parameters on one
thread and across sequential owned threads. Isolation changes neither serving
policy nor numerical tolerances. `scripts/test-native-gpu-ci.py` verifies both
gates execute once, reject failures/empty/skipped runs and preserve later gates.

Owned eviction defers while an authenticated reader holds its exact-file lease and retires after the lease drains. External unlink remains an absent miss; epoch-invalidation fixtures explicitly rotate the durable epoch because ordinary per-file maintenance preserves it.

The complete-checkpoint, epoch, owned-retirement and FIFO fixtures accept
`DARKBLOOM_SSD_TEST_TMPDIR` as an explicit test-only parent directory. It must
already exist, be absolute, writable and canonical, without symlink components.
Invalid or empty values fail rather than falling back; when absent, Foundation's
normal temporary parent is retained. Each fixture creates and removes only its
own UUID child. This does not change the production cache root or disk reserve.
Foundation's Darwin temporary directory may ignore `TMPDIR`, so verify the actual
selected filesystem and sufficient free space for encrypted donation tests.
The tiny `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` path-alias cases deliberately retain their real
system locations. `SSDTestDirectoryTests` covers selector behavior;
`SSDNoFollowIOSpecialFileTests` uses bounded reaped subprocesses to check FIFO
rejection, normal-file behavior and descriptor cleanup.

For bounded shorter complete-checkpoint restoration, keep the original
`SSDShorterCheckpointRestoreTests` oracles: authenticated plan, real shared-paged
admission and provider destination refusal; one-retry cap; non-capacity and
corruption controls; retirement, epoch, close, cancellation, waiting-file and
same-ID replacement fences; exact adopted page/recurrent bits. Add
`SSDCheckpointReadBudgetTests` for actual encrypted framing/EOF, hard remaining
byte bounds and cooperative clock checks, `SSDShorterRestoreClockTests` for
deterministic original-deadline/retirement/file-wait behavior, and `SSDShorterNativeBlockRestoreTests`
for independent native-block reservation refusal, exact adopted state and suffix
output. The latter suites explicitly select CPU; their tiny native decoder is
not a deployed-model performance measurement. They use the same explicit test
root and unchanged disk floor. After a source-matched build/resource setup:

```bash
swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing --no-parallel \
  --filter 'SSDShorterCheckpointRestoreTests|SSDCheckpointReadBudgetTests|SSDShorterRestoreClockTests|SSDShorterNativeBlockRestoreTests'
```

The held-file clock test explicitly releases its fixture access after advancing
time; it does not prove a deadline interrupts an awaited file/refund/native
operation. The new native-block `allocation` negative injects an error before
native allocation; actual native post-materialization failure remains unproven
by that test. Then run the wider CPU storage selection above and the existing
`NativeDiffusionCheckpointStoreTests` controls, particularly
`scopeCapacityCancellationAndTamperNeverPublishAStage` and
`missingProcessAuthorityAndIncompatibleRequestCannotConsumeOrDeleteGoodData`,
for scope, initial capacity, cancellation, tamper, wrong-consumer and ownership
checks. Those controls are not substitutes for a native post-materialization
fault injection. Report each original
baseline cell and new boundary cell separately; a changed compiler/resource
failure is not the intended old-behavior failure. Native source tests do not
qualify actual-model latency, authenticated HTTP reuse or persistent-key restart.

For the existing idle-expiry contract, run the nine deterministic boundary cells:

```bash
swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing --no-parallel \
  --filter 'SSDPrefixCacheLifecycleTests/ttlStageBeforeSweepCharacterization|SSDHybridCheckpointRecencyTests/ttlReadBoundaryWithoutSweep'
```

The complete-checkpoint read boundary uses the current default TTL at ages
1799, 1800 and 1801 seconds; explicit 900-second attention fixtures retain their
configured-policy characterization. Attention eligibility is
sweep-enforced; complete-checkpoint reads reject expiry without awaiting a sweep.
The tests do not extend retention or assert immediate physical erasure. They
require real donation, exact restored values, unchanged retained ciphertext and
drained reservations, not just an index lookup.

For real Gemma checkpoint reconstruction, select the exact QAT artifact and an
existing canonical writable test directory with the normal free-space reserve:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GEMMA_CHECKPOINT_RESTART=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_GEMMA_QAT_MODEL_DIRECTORY=/absolute/path/to/exact-gemma-qat-snapshot \
DARKBLOOM_SSD_TEST_TMPDIR=/absolute/path/to/owned-test-parent \
swift test --skip-build --disable-xctest --enable-swift-testing --no-parallel \
  --filter 'GemmaQATCheckpointRestartLiveTests/sameKeyNewEngineRestores'
```

The directory override is test-only and never changes saved model-cache settings.
The fixture checks its original full aggregate before and after load, uses the
owned test parent, verifies adopted checkpoint state and tenant refusal, and
requires restored output to equal cache-OFF output. It prints first-content and
terminal timings for all four requests. Its same-key engine reconstruction uses
an ephemeral fixture key; it is **not** signed Keychain recovery across processes.
See the [connected cache qualification report](../reports/2026-09-27-cache-connected-qualification.md)
for measured scope and remaining release-runner requirements.

Carry the same build-system and scratch-path options used for that build.
Require nonzero execution and report skips/failures separately. Current results
and remaining scope are in the dated report below; test sources or compilation
alone do not establish native, model or signed-Keychain qualification.

`TestIntegrationConnectedCacheRetirement` uses the normal explicit connected
fixture input with the immutable Bonsai model, SSD on and native MTP off. It
sets a 0.75 GiB budget only for newly owned test provider roots, then requires
real eviction, unchanged epochs, accepted READY/hit receipts, identical output
and reuse of a previously advertised 2,048/4,096-token survivor, followed by a
4,096-token stable repeat. Both providers compete normally after the donor.
Run the ordinary ten-case
`TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP` separately with SSD off and on to cover
tenant separation, routing, tools/media, cancellation and sidecar fallback.
These are local mock-coordinator gates, not hosted routing certification or
release-signed persistent-key evidence.
See [the diagnostic report](../reports/2026-09-24-cache-eviction-publication.md) for evidence and limits.

The Nemotron coordinator-serving path uses typed SDK events. `OpenAIServiceTests`
and `ToolCallParserIntegrationTests` in `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Tests/MLXLMServerTests`
check SSE/collected reasoning, content, tool calls, usage and terminals without
starting a localhost server. `MutableInputKernelTests` and
`MutableInputExportTests` in the SDK's `Tests/OnboardingQualificationTests`
exercise declared Metal writes, alias ownership and export/import. CI runs each
selected suite through the nonzero/no-skip wrapper
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/run-nested-suite.sh`).
The wrapper passes the complete filter unchanged to Swift and uses a fixed
temporary-file prefix, so long alternations and suite/test selectors cannot
exceed filesystem name limits. `scripts/test-provider-ci-workflow.py` exercises
that path alongside the nonzero-test, no-skip and failure-exit checks.

MiMo source and tests are grouped under their existing modules' `MiMo/`
folders; Swift target names are unchanged. The SDK's
`MiMoV26EncodedVisualDecoderTests` covers rounded sampling bounds and compressed
payload ceilings before real platform decoder entry. Normal provider
`swift build --build-tests` does not compile a dependency's SDK test targets;
compile and run the SDK package tests separately as CI does. Small selected
native runners do not replace these whole-target compile checks.

`MiMoV26OpenRouterMediaTests` uses checked-in JPEG, MP4 and MOV bytes from the
OpenRouter conformance cases. It verifies full-size decoding, production
geometry and frame-working-set bounds, plus tiny native vision equivalence.
`MiMoV26VisionWorkingSetTests` checks the fused-kernel selection and conservative
CPU/custom-stream/geometry fallback. `MiMoV26AudioWorkingSetTests` checks actual
tile accounting and lazy/bounded numerical equivalence across mixed clips.
The SDK CI lane also creates a fresh tiny MiMo fixture and runs the complete
`MiMoV26NativeMediaDeadlineTests` suite with explicit native-lane flags. It
covers target-only rates, queued text, idle bootstrap, evidence expiry, capacity
refusal and actual cancellation/retirement. The provider media-admission gate
also selects its native bootstrap/learning sequence and sealed deadline
refusal/compatibility cases. Both lanes use the nonzero/no-skip wrapper.
The tiny learning fixture uses short prompts so warmed kernels stay within the
unchanged production rate plausibility checks; its speed is not model evidence.
`TestMediaMemoryRefusalPreservesTextOnSameProvider` separately exercises actual
coordinator HTTP/WebSocket dispatch with scripted provider refusals followed
by successful text. These gates do not replace full-size signed-provider
qualification on the target hardware.

The retained-fence case in `ProviderLoopNativeMiMoLifetimeTests` also installs a
weight-free non-native peer with a counted engine. A real native fixture fault
in the shared registry must leave that peer's capacity/admission intact and
permit its real bridge submission before and after the fault, while blocking
the native owner, every cold load and reclamation. This is bridge-admission
evidence, not peer-model generation. Keep its fresh-process selector and lane guard;
the deliberately retained native owner must live until that test process exits.
The audiovisual ingress cancellation test returns `Void` from its child task:
it still checks real decode cancellation and host-reservation settlement, without
transferring an unused non-Sendable decoded-media result across `Task.value`.
Inside that task, call the concrete test type rather than dynamic `Self`:
Swift 6.3's region-based isolation checker can reject the latter form. Keep
the same plan, cancellation order, real decode and reservation assertions;
do not add unchecked sendability or suppress cancellation to compile the test.

`NativeLocalConsumerOwnershipTests` waits for the parent cancellation handler
to be installed before asserting that cancellation closes its native lease.
The preparation task entering its own barrier does not establish that ordering.
The fixture still requires cancellation-insensitive cleanup to finish before
the lease is released.

The complete-prefix methods in `MiMoV26NativeLoadTransactionTests` require a
strict generated **asymmetric** tiny BF16 fixture with three synthetic MTP
heads and enough context for the unchanged 257-token prompt, eight output tokens
and speculative padding (the qualified fixture declares 1,024). Set
`MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES` to its parent, with the fixture at `tiny-bf16`,
and `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1`; a symmetric or 128-context fixture does not
exercise this contract. The default MTP case retains a 512-token prefill chunk
and 2,048-token maximum work envelope. Positive bridge-serving fixtures use
2 GiB logical contiguous grants to preserve the production minimum KV allowance;
these grants do not eagerly allocate that amount of device memory. Intentional
underfunded cases retain their smaller grants:
a separate 16 MiB case must refuse without executing a native step, creating
a duplicate bridge reservation or changing process ownership, then retire
cleanly. The bridge's native concurrency gate now rejects that case before
SDK submission. Tests assert one target KV/ring charge plus exactly one bounded
assistant work envelope, not a second legacy per-token assistant charge.

`MiMoMemoryAdmissionTests` covers the production-scale loaded-but-zero-budget
arithmetic, grant shrink/grow, unknown and overflowing costs, the watermark and
per-model serviceability floor. It also calls the pinned SDK's
`MiMoV26PrefillMemoryBudget` with one-versus-four-request workspace cases.
The isolated native memory-admission CI step runs the real tiny-model
`MiMoV26ManagedSlotTests.testNativeMemoryAdmission` cases for heartbeat
shrink/grow, fleet clamping and new-slot refusal, plus
`MiMoV26NativeLoadTransactionTests.testNativeShutdownActivitySurvivesPendingHostUntilRealQuiescentDrain`
for pending occupancy and second-request refusal. It reuses the built test
bundle and generated symmetric fixture; no fake native completion is issued.
The same step runs
`MiMoV26StandaloneLifecycleTests.testNativeMemoryAdmissionReserveRaiseUsesWorkspaceFloor`
against an actual local MiMo owner. It checks that local load/reserve preflights
retain the engine's fixed workspace floor and leave its live grant unchanged
when a proposed reserve raise would strand it.

The same native suite holds an actual pre-submit caller while the SDK becomes
quiescent: whole-Mac forecast invalidation must remain owned until that caller
unwinds and the matching bridge drain succeeds. The retained-fence test keeps
that activity across a repeated failed retirement and unrelated peer drain.
Neither forecast invalidation nor these tiny-model tests certify full-checkpoint
memory release, production cache composition or selected-model generation.

`AudioInputRejectionTests` preserves early no-acquisition/no-decode refusals for
generic or unknown models, and checks that a MiMo-looking request name grants
nothing. A metadata-only native dispatch probe may enter normal cold acquisition;
an actual acquired generic model must still refuse and release its lease.
`MiMoV26ManagedAudioProviderTests` also routes typed Chat and Responses WAV input
through the normal scheduler with a genuinely published synthetic target and
owned audio sidecar, checking native work, host joins and retirement. Direct
decoder or `submitDecodedAudioMedia` tests alone do not cover these ingress guards.

`MiMoV26DiscoveryLoadFootprintTests` checks metadata-only quote revalidation,
including foreign-family, SSD-discount, underpricing and changed-inventory
refusals. The native `MiMoV26StandaloneLifecycleTests` scanner-quoted regression
uses real `ModelScanner.parseModelInfo` output with a positive transient allowance
and no SSD discount through ordinary loading, publication and retirement; a
handwritten `ModelInfo` without that field does not cover this boundary.
The same suite exercises actual preload → listener bind → same-owner stop, and
refuses listener startup while a real native preload is held before publication.

The nested SDK's `MiMoV26AudioTokenizerEncoderTests` also exercises real strict
checkpoint installation into the indexed downsampling module array, exact
transpose values, and missing/extra/shape/dtype refusals. Run these tests in the
SDK package; a sidecar header audit or a provider test build does not run them.

`TestReserveProviderWithPlanPrimarySelectionUnchanged` compares selection and
costs exactly while normalizing only wall-clock profiling ages, including
first-content capacity/performance sample ages. Two independently constructed
fleets need not have identical elapsed milliseconds; forecast and freshness
behavior remain covered by the separate first-content tests.

`ModelScannerSnapshotSymlinkTests` covers ordinary/linked snapshot resolution
and explicit revision selection. Missing refs retain the legacy path; existing
bad refs cannot switch a hidden managed selection to a different visible
snapshot. The fixtures exercise real denied reads, symlinks and a nonblocking
FIFO refusal without reading model weights.

For HF artifact downloads, `HuggingFaceDownloadTests` covers source preference,
checksum rejection, fallback, and cancellation. Native Nemotron CI also runs
`NemotronHTests`, `NemotronH35BackendParityTests`, `NemotronH35StorageParityTests`,
`NemotronH35MTPTests`, and `NemotronH35MTPPrimingTests` with nonzero/no-skip guards.
The MTP tests cover native paged storage, typed durable prefix history, rollback,
and teardown; `CBv2QwenMTPIntegrationTests` independently covers allocation-refusal
ownership in the shared engine. Loaded-artifact tests remain an additional gate,
not evidence supplied by tiny fixtures. `scripts/test-publish-model.sh`
checks the artifact workflow payload. `TestHuggingFaceArtifactPostgresAndCache`
in `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/hugging_face_artifact_test.go` uses a disposable
`DATABASE_URL` to check storage and cache invalidation.

`ProductionPromptParityTests` drives the real model-free `MLXOpenAIService`
preparation seam before tokenization. The shared public corpus covers JSON-object
and schema response formats plus multi-system and text/tool/endpoint forms; it compares
actual Swift tokens and scope-bound hashes with Rust plans. No production
prompts or model weights are needed (`scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh`).

For the DiffusionGemma live gates, use the immutable public checkpoint:

```bash
hf download mlx-community/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit \
  --revision a7a81407613811e8ba63af92ac0d852b809e191f
export DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR="$HOME/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit/snapshots/a7a81407613811e8ba63af92ac0d852b809e191f"
(cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests)
./scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh "$(cd provider-swift && swift build --show-bin-path)"
(cd provider-swift && DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_ENCRYPTED_LIVE=1 DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0 \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh nativeTextToolsMediaAndHistoryCrossTheEncryptedWire --no-parallel)
```

The encrypted provider gate and SDK portable-state gate share
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Tests/MLXLMTests/DiffusionGemmaArtifactFixture.swift`
(`DiffusionGemmaArtifactFixture.verify`). It pins the file inventory, sizes and
SHA-256 checksums from that revision and streams the actual bytes, including
processor and generation metadata. HF snapshot symlinks are supported; missing,
modified or additional files fail verification. No private local verification
receipt is required. The provider imports the same test helper through a source
symlink; it does not change startup scanning or production attestation.

`scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh` first calls the source-verifying metallib builder,
then replaces both the executable-colocated library and the nested test resource
used for cache identity. Use it after rebuilding either Swift package's tests.
The Make target and CI use this shared setup. The native cancellation fixture
resolves `localhost` and tries its address families; its hermetic socket test
covers separate IPv4 and IPv6 listeners.

`python3 scripts/test-stage-test-metallib.py` runs the real staging script with
isolated fetch/copy fixtures. It checks Darwin and non-Darwin copy flags, all
test-bundle layouts, destination preservation, and staging cleanup on copy or
comparison failure. No Metal compiler or model is needed.

For a new native family, run the same production corpus against its exact
config/tokenizer/template artifacts before accepting cache routing. Diffusion
controls are mirrored by `coordinator/promptsidecar/src/diffusion.rs`; its tests
cover positive effort, explicit boolean precedence, absence and invalid efforts.
`DiffusionGemmaPromptParityLiveTests` can isolate the real artifact's tool-turn
shape without loading weights. `DiffusionGemmaMediaNormalizationTests` checks
that media follows the same input formatter without losing decoded assets or
enabling AR grammar. Keep renderer/prompt parity distinct from generation quality.

`DiffusionToolResultMediaTests` verifies decoded tool-result pixels and symbolic
placeholder order against actual call IDs, including reversed result arrival,
unsupported-role refusals and legacy isolation. `NativeMediaToolsCapabilityTests`
covers family-scoped advertisement plus ordinary/attested registration and model
updates. Go `TestNativeMediaTools` cases cover model updates/revocation, final
reservation, aliases, owner routing, retry exclusions and queued media-result
requests without forced choice. Run these before actual encrypted coordinator
media/tool fixtures; component passes do not establish generated tool quality.

`TestLowerResponsesInstructions` runs the same shared instruction vectors through
serving and cache lowering. `TestResponsesInlineMediaReachesEncryptedProviderInOrder`
combines instructions with ordered user and tool-result media in both transport
modes. `TestResponsesInstructionsAdmissionEstimates` checks pre-lowering routing
and billing bounds. When this contract changes, regenerate the current full
production corpus from its immutable manifests and verify independent Swift
tokenizer/template parity; do not replace a current corpus with older PR fixtures.

`DiffusionGemmaTokenizerParityLiveTests` compares the actual local tokenizer
against an independently produced synthetic oracle without loading weights.
Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_PARITY=1`, set
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_DIR` to the verified tokenizer directory and
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_TOKENIZER_ORACLE` to the retained oracle JSON. The oracle
contains 16 entries with `text`, `tokenIds`, `decoded` and
`decodedSkippingSpecial`; compare exact UTF-8 bytes, not Unicode-equivalent
Swift strings. The SDK has the matching `DiffusionGemmaTokenizerLiveTests` gate.
Keep encoding, decoding and model semantic quality verdicts distinct.

`DiffusionGemmaRawCaseLiveTests` replays retained synthetic API fixtures through
the same native prompt contract and records output before reasoning/tool parsing.
Its explicit `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_RAW_CASE_DIAGNOSTIC` opt-in requires the selected
artifact and `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_RAW_CASES_DIR`; run it alone under an external
memory/time guard. Keep raw diagnostics private. Fixed diagnostic seeds do not
reproduce an earlier unseeded API failure, and successful execution is not a
semantic-quality pass. Never repair literal arguments merely to satisfy a fixture.

`DiffusionGemmaFourCallDiagnosticLiveTests` uses the existing DEBUG-only native
text observer during a bounded set of actual authenticated HTTP requests. Its
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_FOUR_CALL_DIAGNOSTIC` opt-in records every new unseeded
trajectory and compares parsing of original chunks with their concatenation.
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_FOUR_CALL_CASE` selects only `responses-four-on-stream`
(the default) or `responses-four-on-plain` from the retained synthetic directory.
The test checks the fixture's case and transport flag, records its receipt hash,
and keeps the same fixed sixteen-trial budget. Unknown names and traversal are
rejected by `DiffusionGemmaFourCallFixtureTests`; selecting a plain fixture must
not be represented as streaming coverage or replay of the original random draw.
It retains failures and checks drain between requests; it is not retry-until-pass
qualification or an exact replay of an earlier unrecorded random seed. Raw text
and response captures remain private and are never production telemetry.
`NativeToolStreamRouterTests` separately proves that four complete native frames
remain four calls, while four starts with only one closing marker fail closed
across chunk boundaries. A permissive parser returning one call is not a passing
four-call result; do not silently repair the omitted protocol markers.

`DiffusionGemmaNamedToolDiagnosticLiveTests` adds a fixed four-round matrix of
retained named-tool Responses requests, reasoning on/off and plain/streaming.
Its `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_NAMED_TOOL_DIAGNOSTIC=1` opt-in uses the same model and
synthetic case-directory inputs. It captures native chunks before parsing and
compares joined/chunked parser outcomes, with a bounded drain after every request.
Successful diagnostic collection is not a tool-quality pass. Keep both earlier
unseeded failures and every newly captured outcome; never retry until green.

`DiffusionGemmaReasoningEmissionTests` deterministically replays the captured
unclosed-thought shape through the provider adapter without loading weights.
It requires failure without exposing disabled reasoning or invoking the embedded
tool, at fragmented and whole-chunk boundaries. It also preserves enabled
reasoning, empty envelopes and literal markers in arguments, and verifies that a
failed router cannot resume. `DiffusionGemmaReasoningControlTests` compares output
permission against the renderer's Boolean/effort precedence. These component
checks complement, but do not replace, actual model and HTTP qualification.
The same suite sends the scripted captured output through the real shared local
HTTP application on a loopback socket, covering both APIs and stream modes. It
checks authentication before submission, sanitized failure terminals, absence of
disabled thought/tool bytes and the unchanged forced-tool 422 classification.
This transport fixture is not live model-generation evidence.

For media-cache deadline attribution only,
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MEDIA_TRACE_ROOT` points to a new private directory for exact
synthetic image/video request bodies. `DiffusionGemmaMediaPrefixLiveTests` records
phase timings and preserves its original client deadline and assertions. The
export excludes authentication headers and weights. A later quiet pass does not
erase an earlier cold timeout; compare the captured request on the actual
optimized CLI and keep diagnostic versus normal-gate results separate.

`DiffusionLongContextLiveTests` exercises repeated contiguous and paged requests
through the normal native benchmark factory, including load-hash brackets and
shared memory admission. Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_LONG_CONTEXT_LIVE=1`, point
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR` at the verified selected artifact, and choose one
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_CONTEXT_TOKENS` value per guarded process. It defaults to
4096; larger cells require a fresh physical-memory/headroom check. Prompts retain
complete chat framing and are sized using the actual tokenizer. Require exact
output equality, the known-answer oracle and post-retirement owner release.
The `262016` target reserves the artifact's remaining output capacity so the
actual prompt plus requested output equals its native context exactly; it does
not claim that many input tokens alone or suppress an early native EOS.
The short answer measures long prefill/state correctness, not sustained decode
or finalized-visible-token performance. Its MLX peak includes loading; preserve
the external physical-footprint trace separately. A SwiftPM helper is a distinct
executable from its test bundle: runtime identity requires the source-matched
Metal library beside the actual test host, without modifying the installed
toolchain or bypassing production binding.
The native benchmark installs the same `MLXMemoryGuard.configureOnce` policy
as serving before loading. The fixture asserts the actual allocator limits;
do not use MLX's uncapped default pool as a production memory baseline.

`DiffusionVisibleThroughputLiveTests` measures sustained finalized visible output
through the same native factory. Enable `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_VISIBLE_BENCH_LIVE=1`
with the verified `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_MODEL_DIR`. It runs three 2,048-token-output
iterations per contiguous/paged backend with the unchanged native canvas and
sampler. Require equal original token IDs across repeats, sufficient visible
output, and post-retirement release. The metric excludes initial protocol framing
only at a proved original-token boundary and includes first-block generation;
it does not count refinement work or retokenize displayed text. Run its metric
helper tests as well, including literal markers and malformed framing. Inspect
the generated synthetic text separately: a valid rate/equality result is not a
quality pass or proof of the performance target. Retain all iteration timings,
exact build configuration and source/resource identities.

The ordinary native benchmark can emit the
[descriptor-route diagnostic](../reference/configuration.md#native-diffusiongemma-expert-reduction).
Run it only with an idle, exclusively owned model process. The first iteration
observes core descriptor dispatch, DiffusionGemma weighted reduction and
soft-conditioning projection and compiled-sampler dispatch; later
iterations require the disarmed counters to remain unchanged. All iterations
remain in benchmark output, so exclude the first from performance comparisons.
`DiffusionBenchmarkRouteProbeTests` checks explicit activation, warmup/order,
changed counters and invalid boundaries without loading a model. This observer
does not change requested routing or establish numerical/API qualification.
The SDK's `DiffusionGemmaSoftEmbeddingTests` covers explicit activation,
geometry/device/training exclusions, compile/grad/JVP/vmap guards, exact fallback
computation and counter arming/retirement. Full-weight qualification separately
compares both conditioning formats, complete raw logits/state and original
committed output. A projection-only timing is not a model or provider speedup.
`DiffusionGemmaNativeSamplerTests` checks fallback controls and request-local key
ordering. Its bounded GPU regression requires both
`DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_SAMPLER_NUMERICAL_EDGE_LIVE=1` and the compiled-sampler switch
from the configuration reference. It exercises near-uniform categorical draws
at an extreme finite temperature without loading model weights. Preserve exact
integer, uniform/Gumbel, state and committed-output checks; equal seeds alone
do not establish unchanged sampling. Full serving, first-use and memory gates
remain separate from that regression.

`DiffusionGemmaConcurrencyLiveTests` compares native mixed text, reasoning
OFF/ON tools and image cohorts with isolated responses, requiring actual native
overlap at widths two and four. It also tests quiet socket-reset cancellation,
survivor equality and retained-old-bridge unload/reload. The existing short-prompt
cell can finish a row before media preparation admits the fourth; preserve any
missed-width result rather than treating four launched tasks as proof. The
separate `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_UNCACHED_PREFILL_COHORT_LIVE=1` cell requires cacheOFF
and matched prompts over1,024tokens to sustain overlap. It retains the same
four-way criterion, native execution and deadlines, and records HTTP start/finish
and sampled native-active transitions. Neither cell proves fused GPU batching.

`DiffusionGemmaStopLiveTests` separately checks authenticated Chat HTTP and SSE
on paged storage, with a known-answer control and a caller stop inside that
answer. It requires `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_STOP_HTTP_LIVE=1` and the same selected
artifact locator. Require clipped content, reduced completion usage, matching
stream/nonstream usage, one terminal and released request reservations. SDK
`NativeBlockEngineTests` provides the independent original-token accounting
oracle for same-block/cross-block stops, Unicode, cleanup, EOS and cancellation.

Child-executable fixtures resolve only the running test configuration through
`LiveInferenceFixtures.buildProduct`: native SwiftPM `debug`/`release` and
SwiftBuild `Debug`/`Release` are supported without borrowing a peer build.
`LiveInferenceMetallibSourceTests` covers both layouts and rejects unknown or
escaping paths. Stage all declared resources in the consumer's expected layout,
including Qwen4 Metal headers, before running the real child `runtime-smoke` and
`SelfUpdaterTests`. Resource discovery is distinct from model inference; local
ad-hoc signed fixtures do not establish release signing or production attestation.

Installer onboarding regression coverage runs with `scripts/test-install-atomic.sh`.
The provider CI job runs `python3 scripts/test-profile-inventory-auth.py` on macOS. Its pseudo-terminal fixtures compile the production profile-inventory helper, verify foreground password prompting without echo, exercise nonzero exits and failed spawns in a foreground terminal, and reject background terminal jobs and noninteractive reads without invoking real `sudo` or changing profiles.
It invokes `scripts/test-install-onboarding.py`, which executes the actual setup
function with profile/network/Settings effects mocked: macOS 27+, older and unknown
versions, existing management, and unavailable enrollment. This checks setup
routing only; signed Mac App Attest qualification is separate.
It also invokes `scripts/test-install-coordinator-binding.py`, which runs the
installer's `--bind-coordinator-test` hook (with `COORD_URL` set) against
temporary `provider.toml` files: production removes only the
`[coordinator] url` line and creates no file, and other coordinators replace or
add only that line. `InstallerCoordinatorBindingTests`
(`provider-swift/Tests/DarkbloomCLITests/`) loads the result through the CLI
config loaders, and `TestServedInstallerBindsProviderToServingCoordinator`
(`coordinator/tests/api/releases/contracts/install_test.go`) runs the installer
as the coordinator serves it.

`go test ./coordinator/tests/cmd/devnet-seed` seeds a throwaway database on a
**disposable** `DATABASE_URL` through `devnetseed.Run`
(`coordinator/internal/command/devnetseed`), checks row counts and balances,
and checks that a database with users is refused before migrations run.

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Coordinator/CoordinatorIntegrationTests.swift`
exercises enrollment over real local HTTP with a linked test token and P-256
signer. The fixture verifies the canonical token-bound signature rather than
accepting anonymous profile downloads; no production credentials are used.

Build qualification regressions run in `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/app_attest_builds_test.go`, `coordinator/tests/appattest/service/authorization/build_qualifications_test.go`, `coordinator/tests/api/releases/contracts/app_attest_builds_test.go`, and `coordinator/tests/api/releases/contracts/app_attest_builds_auth_test.go`. The route tests validate real ES256 Privy JWTs through the mux, server-attributed audit actors, and rejection of admin-owned inference keys. The real PostgreSQL contract requires a **disposable** `DATABASE_URL` (the harness truncates test tables). Test memory/decorated/Postgres persistence, conflicting identities, publish/revoke races, cache fencing, lease expiry and reload; run the affected Go packages with `-race`. `python3 scripts/test-provider-release-publication.py` tests blocked publication, immutable artifacts, retained-byte R2 staging retries across workflow attempts, literal tag-note preservation and recovery after draft creation, interrupted upload, completed upload and publication failures without credentials or live writes; CI runs it with `scripts/test-provider-release-pipeline.py`. The annotated-tag fixture supplies its own commit/tag identity with global and system Git configuration disabled, so a developer account cannot mask missing CI setup. These checks do not replace final signed-Mac/Apple qualification.

### MiMo encoded audio release regression

The `testNativeAudioRelease` gates
load the real selected audio codec beside a small synthetic native target,
use ordinary serving memory policy, send an authenticated streaming WAV request
with mono/22050 Hz/PCM8/47048 samples and the exact public OpenRouter H.264/AAC
video (stereo/32000 Hz), require generated tokens and terminal usage, and join
real ownership before asserting all charges are released.
Set `MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AUDIO_PROVIDER_TESTS=1`, `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1`, and
`MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AUDIO_FIXTURE_ROOT` to the generated `tiny-bf16` directory.
Set `MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AAC_VIDEO_FIXTURE` to the verified video file emitted by
the fixture preparation script.
Use `prepare-mimo-audio-fixtures.py --cache <cache> --output <new-directory>`;
its public codec download is about 1.87 GB and is checked against fixed hashes.

The optional Bedrock reviewer installs hash-locked dependencies from
`.github/scripts/requirements-bedrock.txt` in its trusted workflow.
`python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-bedrock.py` covers explicit provider fallback,
Sonnet 5.5 fallback identity, production smoke schema validation (including the
boolean `needs_deeper_review`), and conditional merge clearance without cloud calls.
The smoke script calls `budget_scan.py` (`Scanner.call`, `Scanner.integrate`) with
caching disabled, one source pass and one integration pass per model. Live validation and activation
are separate: see [the rollout runbook](../operations/threat-review-rollout.md).

## Provider lifecycle regression checks

Serving measurements and profile admission have focused suites
`EngineEarlyPerformanceTests`, `EngineV2PrefillSamplingTests`,
`ServingPerformanceProfileTests` and the shared profiler-wire fixture. Run the
ordinary provider test target as well as dependency tests for
`CBv2RequestTimingTests`, `NativeBlockEngineTests` and
`CBv2MixedStepPrefillQuotaTests` after changing the CBv2 pin. The Go registry
suite covers accepted counter deltas, stale/replayed observations, shared
service admission, warm-load ownership and transport freshness.

`make benchmark-wrapper-test` also runs the offline serving-profile evaluator
regressions. Release Integrity CI runs this same `serving_performance` suite,
including evidence validation and generated-catalog consistency, without a GPU
or model downloads. Its SQL fixtures additionally require local PostgreSQL
binaries and a non-root user; unavailable prerequisites are reported as skips.
The fixture discovers a complete installation through `PATH`, `pg_config`, or
Debian's versioned binary directories. It uses `LC_ALL=C`, a private Unix socket
and an available port. An installed cluster that fails to start fails the test
with its startup log, rather than being reported as missing coverage.
Promoted deadline records must also reproduce the archived raw training and
validation runs and pass the current evaluator with actual prerequisite files;
schema validity alone is insufficient.
The evidence index binds every ordered catalog row's ID, qualification-report
digest and full-profile digest even when the optional archive replay is skipped.
The current deadline catalog is empty. Historical hardware reports and the
prompt-count corpus are stored outside the repository; their three replay tests
run only with `DARKBLOOM_QUALIFICATION_EVIDENCE_ROOT` set. See
[local evidence checks](serving-performance-qualification.md#verify-local-evidence).
Ordinary CI still pins the reviewed prompt-count coefficients and checks
runtime boundaries and synthetic posture failures without those archives.
For real hardware coverage and required evidence, follow
[serving performance qualification](serving-performance-qualification.md).
Synthetic tests never certify M5 concurrency or a mixed-prefill default.
Calibrated admission adds `DeadlineCalibrationTests`, `PromptWorkTests`, the
shared calibrated-capacity fixture, and SDK `CBv2CalibratedFirstContentTests`.
Go and Swift also consume the same synthetic deadline-decision fixture for
cache reuse, existing-owner bounds, live-rate ceilings and the remaining clock;
it tests arithmetic agreement and does not qualify hardware.
`coordinator/api/promptwork` tests body/model memoization, original-clock planner
bounds and measured shape restrictions. The optional API corpus projection
uses the production heuristic and writes numeric data only; the qualification
guide documents its environment variables and paired tokenizer run.

Run `make provider-test` to build tests and install the source-matched Metal
library beside the runner. Focused suites include `ProviderLifecycleTests`,
`LifecycleMailboxTests`, `ServiceDrainTests`, `LocalResponseTrackerTests`,
`CoordinatorLifecycleBarrierTests`, `ProviderSignalTests`, and
`AutoUpdateLifecycleOverlapTests`. They cover accepted concurrent/cold work,
slow final writes, expiry, force, command interruption, update overlap, process
identity, wire ordering, unsupported acknowledgements and real-process SIGTERM.

The isolated launchd integration is opt-in on a logged-in macOS session:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LAUNCHD_TESTS=1 swift test --skip-build --filter LaunchAgentDrainIntegrationTests
```

It uses a unique temporary GUI-domain label and plist, never the installed
provider/watchdog. `TestProviderDrainAckFollowsUsageSettlementAndKeepsControlTrafficAlive`
in `coordinator/tests/api/provider/contracts/provider_drain_barrier_test.go` runs both streaming and
non-streaming traffic against the actual coordinator, delays asynchronous
settlement, sends duplicate terminals, and verifies one usage record before
acknowledgement. Run it and the dispatch/drain tests with Go's race detector.

Release qualification still requires a Developer ID-signed installed provider
against real coordinator traffic, with App Attest or legacy authorization. A
unit test, simulated provider, ad-hoc signature or green CI is not that evidence.


## Bonsai performance qualification

The default-on eligible profile is documented in
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/bonsai2.md`. Record unset/default, explicit `1` and
explicit `0` process profiles separately; an unset control is no longer OFF.
Unchanged weights and equal greedy tokens do not replace independent raw-logit
and native-state comparisons. `Float16ConstantCastTests` and
`PrismPrefillCarryPolicyTests` cover absent/explicit/invalid overrides;
`PrismPrefillCarrySubmissionTests` runs the real scheduling, fault and retirement
checks in both unset/default and explicit-ON processes with its GPU/witness opt-ins.

`BonsaiEncryptedCheckpointLiveTests` requires the verified unchanged artifact
and an exclusively owned GPU lane. Select it separately from other live model
suites; its gate is `DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_LIVE_MODEL` plus
`DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_EXCLUSIVE_GPU=1`. It prepares actual image/tool/video inputs,
checks native three-row joins/shrink/cancellation against isolated tokens, then
uses the production paged factory and encrypted complete-checkpoint store for
cold/hot, same-process reopen, tenant/prefix misses and corrupted-ciphertext
recomputation. Its random fixture key/root do not touch Keychain or production
cache data and do not qualify signed persistence or hosted routing.

```sh
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_LIVE_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/verified-artifact \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI2_EXCLUSIVE_GPU=1 \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_PREFILL_CARRY_ASYNC=1 \
DARKBLOOM_BONSAI_F16_CONSTANT_CACHE=1 \
swift test --build-system native -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
  -Xswiftc -DDEBUG --filter BonsaiEncryptedCheckpointLiveTests --no-parallel
```

These are qualification instructions, not a claim that an unrun gate passed.
Use a separate test build, its adjacent resource bundles and exact matching
Metal library, and an owned-process memory/time guard. The ordinary production
binary must also pass the final local Chat/Responses, reasoning/tool/history and
multimodal API matrix. Keep the final local OpenRouter-compatible weather/tool
gate distinct from any unavailable hosted certification.

`LocalOutputTokenLimitTests` checks the complete provider-local responder stack,
not only the SDK router: authenticated intercepted chat aliases/batches and
routed Completions/Responses must preserve the SDK's early HTTP 400 before
model acquisition, while missing authentication still returns 401.
`NativeToolStreamRouterTests` includes Bonsai's explicit nested-reasoning policy
and opaque XML string arguments. Its policy must be wired for both text and
media, with other families unchanged. Do not "repair" generated quoted strings
by guessing JSON unescaping; the published template renders string parameters
as raw values. Keep model copying quality separate from transport fidelity.

`LocalStreamingFailureTests` also exercises the authenticated chat-upload
interceptor, not just the SDK routes. A failure after HTTP headers must finish
with a sanitized SSE error event, without a success terminal or fabricated tool
call. The SDK's `ChatStreamingFailureHTTPTests` covers Chat/Completions framing,
observed-only usage, cancellation and the unchanged direct-service throwing
contract. Successful tool-generation gates remain separate: a correctly framed
error does not satisfy a required tool call or repair its generated arguments.

## Model revision validation

Model revision changes are covered by `ModelPrefetchDownloaderTests`,
`ModelRevisionActivationTests`, `ModelRevisionPublicationTests`, and the existing MTP drain suites in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests`. Run them with a source-matched metallib.
Coordinator lifecycle tests cover memory/cached stores and, when `DATABASE_URL`
points to a disposable database, `TestPostgresModelRevisionLifecycle`.
`python3 scripts/test_publish_model_revision.py` tests publication ordering,
immutable reservations and per-revision HF arguments/request bodies. API and
store regressions cover retired re-registration, publisher attribution, failed
live refresh retries and alias-lineage eligibility; HF download fixtures change
the pinned repo/commit/subdirectory between two revisions. Renamed-file fixtures
exercise equal aggregates through both download paths, and controlled reserve/client
suspensions verify cancellation, rollback, pending alias cleanup and retry. These
fixture tests do not qualify a full-weight fleet swap.


## SDK 27 release qualification

The `qualify-sdk` job in `.github/workflows/release-swift.yml` runs production
prompt parity and `scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` through the same SDK 27 / Swift
6.4 wrapper used by optimized compilation. The two jobs run concurrently on
separate runners; the signing job requires both to succeed. Native GPU tests keep
their existing serial execution and exclusive-process isolation within the
qualification job. A cache hit never skips a test or authorizes publication.

`Qwen4StandaloneAdmissionTests` uses `ScriptedProviderMemory` through
`StandaloneServer`'s `kvBudgetForTesting` initializer. Its synthetic models test
architecture admission, pending-load reservations and cleanup without depending
on the runner's available RAM. The low-headroom case still executes the real
admission check, refuses before weight loading, verifies cleanup, then restores
simulated headroom and retries on the same server. Physical memory and native
allocator tests retain real measurements; fixture success does not qualify the
full Flash-Next model.

The SSD write-behind pipeline tests in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/BoundedSingleConsumerPipelineTests.swift`
cover reusable drains, bounded retention, overflow, cancellation and shutdown.
`pipelineShutdownDrainReleasesLastPayload` repeats the final-payload handoff
10,000 times: after shutdown, drain must wait for the consumer task to finish,
not just for its pending count to reach zero. This catches the payload-release
race that failed the 0.9.6 SDK qualification run. These pipeline source/test
changes also trigger both SDK 27 PR lanes.

Run the focused fixtures and the CPU-only pipeline checks before a release:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --filter Qwen4StandaloneAdmissionTests --no-parallel
swift test --filter pipeline --no-parallel
cd ..
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-cache.py
python3 scripts/test-prepare-metal-toolchain.py
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-pipeline.py
python3 scripts/test-provider-signing-validation.py
```

The cache tests cover compatibility boundaries and content-checked source
mtime replay. Metal setup tests simulate delayed registration, explicit import,
command failure and timeout without installing components. The pipeline checks pin independent build/test dependencies,
signing approval, same-run source-bound artifact transfer, and checks that still
run on cache hits. The existing archive tests reject changed inventory, wrong
source, unsafe members and mismatched entitlements. CI's Release Integrity job
runs these CPU-only checks; the SDK 27 release preparation workflow additionally
runs both native lanes on release-plumbing PRs and round-trips the real unsigned
archive through the same source/inventory verifier used before signing.

## Merged SDK pin validation

After changing `libs/mlx-swift-lm`, compare the merged tree with the tested
review tree and inspect any additional upstream changes. Run the SDK build and
complete test suite independently from `make provider`; both consumers must use
the recorded pins and source-matched Metal libraries. Preserve optional skips
and expected known issues in the results rather than counting them as native
model qualification.

The demanded-prefix change requires four separate SDK selections with no skips:
`CBv2NativeHistoricalRetentionTests`, `CBv2DemandedCheckpointPartitionTests`,
`CBv2DemandedCheckpointContinuationTests`, and
`MiMoV26NativeHistoricalRetentionTests.testDemandedMiddleFrontierSurvivesNativePublicationAndReopenedFork`.
Use the existing [nested SDK procedure](#4-provider-swift--unit-tests-with-a-source-matched-metallib)
and the asymmetric synthetic fixture prepared by
`scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py --asymmetric`. The last selection
requires `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1` and `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES`
pointing to that fixture. These 17 test methods cover retention, partition,
continuation and actual reopened native checkpoints with MTP off and on.
They use tiny synthetic weights, so they do not requalify full-model TTFT,
throughput or fleet cache-hit measurements after a dependency update.

## Native Flash-Next candidate

The [candidate reference](../reference/qwen4-next-support.md#validation-status-and-next-gates)
records completed local checks and remaining gates. The following are commands
for a prepared checkout, not claims that this composed candidate has passed
them. Use the [exact dependency/build prerequisites](build.md#native-flash-next-candidate).

For a merge-only dependency repin, compare the approved and merged Git trees.
A squash merge need not preserve the review head as an ancestor. Record the locked consumer
build and documentation checks separately from model execution. Identical
source does not turn an earlier model receipt into a new binary or hardware
run, and it does not close an outstanding performance or lifecycle finding.

The [Qwen 3.8 Next reproducibility scripts](../../scripts/qwen38_validation/README.md)
exercise an existing loopback release server across MTP OFF/ON, reasoning
OFF/ON, Chat/Responses tools/history, unsupported-effort HTTP 400 boundaries and
isolated ephemeral complete-cache lifecycle checks. The same page gives the
separate real-state and quiet-cancellation/reload Swift opt-ins and their limits.
These local fixtures do not qualify a hosted OpenRouter route or authorize
model uploads, signing or production changes.

Build release test targets with testable imports enabled where the toolchain
requires it (`-Xswiftc -enable-testing`); do not exclude those tests to bypass a
test-build configuration error.

The SDK's `CBv2HiddenResourceTests` covers hidden generated bundles and retained
byte-conflict refusal. Run it together with the existing `CBv2PagedSafetyTests`
and actual layer-submission safety tests on the target hardware; file presence
and build success do not establish resource eligibility in the running process.
The original128-GiB reload gate must retain its normal required headroom even
when background applications prevent the first load. Record that refusal,
resolve the actual machine conditions and keep any separately labelled
diagnostic distinct from the unchanged gate.

Keep all precision controls in receipts. A diagnostic `MLX_ENABLE_TF32=0`
run on NAX hardware is not the default posture and cannot erase an earlier
default-run failure or authorize changing other models' serving behavior.
Unqualified prefill experiments are excluded from this support update.

`FlashNextReclaimDiagnostics` is a separately selected, opt-in observation of
Metal allocation, MLX active/cache, complete native charge/coverage and OS
footprint after the real quiet-prefill lifecycle. It requires
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_RECLAIM_DIAGNOSTIC=1`, exclusive GPU ownership and the same
artifact/offload/cache configuration as the ordinary lifecycle fixture. Its
observation interval is not a fix or a release gate: the original
`FlashNextQuietCancellationReloadLiveTests` still retries immediately, with no
callback/delay or lowered memory requirement. Keep both outcomes separately.

`NativeMemoryReclamationTests` defaults to real 1 GiB MLX backing in an isolated wired
ticket and checks that cache retirement drops Metal allocation ownership while
preserving an independently live array. Select `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_TEST=1`
and the exclusive GPU opt-in; `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_MODE=direct` retains the
old unscoped control, while `scoped` compares a test-only autorelease pool.
This native resource test does not replace the full-artifact immediate-reload,
prefill/decode, memory-tier or numerical gates.
Explicit `DARKBLOOM_NATIVE_RECLAIM_GIB=8|64` repeats the same resource/liveness
assertions at larger scale, requiring 24 GiB of OS-available headroom beyond the
declared probe size. Post-release footprint observations are diagnostics, not a
delay added to the model's immediate-reload gate.

`Qwen4ExpLoadFootprintTests` checks complete header/index coverage, retention of
MTP/vision payloads, FP16/unknown-layout fallbacks and the additive native-load
allowance. `NativeMemoryRetirementWindowTests` checks expiry and cancellation;
these do not replace the actual model reload gate. When the loading policy
changes, retain the old requirement/result separately and record the new
checkpoint-derived allowance, full load peak and actual reload outcome.

For the paired SDK MTP/read-profile candidate, run the SDK's
`Qwen4SelectedPageCopiesTests` and `Qwen4ExpMTPPrimingTests`, the original real
Qwen4 state/output-budget oracles, then native OFF/ON and cold/warm-prefix API
qualification. Read copies compare exact bytes against the original ordered
attention path; assistant closeness tests are not a target-losslessness gate.

`TestIntegration_FlashNextConnectedMatrices` in
`e2e/flash_next_connected_matrix_test.go` is an explicit opt-in for the same API
oracles through a real local Go coordinator. Reserve one owned model/GPU lane
first. Supply `DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CONNECTED_MATRIX=1`, the exact native Next
model ID through `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MODEL` and `TESTBED_MODEL_ID`, a matching
`DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_MODEL_PATH`, and a verified `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` with its
adjacent resources. The pinned checkpoint hash is checked before startup;
similarly named Qwen3.8 27B/M5/NAX fixtures are not substitutes.

Set `DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_MTP` to `off` or `auto`,
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_PYTHON` to the approved Python executable,
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_SCRIPT` to the absolute path of
`scripts/qwen38_validation/connected_matrix_runner.py`, and
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_MATRIX_OUTPUT` to a new private output directory. The
testbed's optional `LocalEndpointPort` uses the native authenticated unified
mode on one locally launched provider. API calls go to the coordinator; metrics
and the original four-field drain checks go to the same provider's loopback
listener. No second model is loaded and neither key is printed or copied from
an operator credential store. Default launches are unchanged.

Retain failures, the one unsupported-high observation, per-suite native metrics
and bounded wire-profile receipts. Synthetic auth, `TrustNone`, skipped
challenges and mock payment services do not qualify production trust or hosted
routing. Audit persistent-key access separately before using a signed runtime.

`TestIntegration_FlashNextExtendedMatrices` is separately opted in with
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_EXTENDED_MATRIX=1`. It keeps the same native/Go setup but
selects the approved runner's `weather`, `fidelity`, `heldout` and `multimodal`
suites. Supply the retained original private fixtures and their verified runner;
do not substitute new prompts, bias special tokens or weaken failed oracles.
These selections report known quality failures and dependency skips separately
from actual request/page retirement and MTP-policy checks. The core 59-cell
matrix remains unchanged.

For single-provider account-cache checks, first run the CPU-only opt-ins in
`e2e/flash_next_cache_manifest_test.go` and
`e2e/flash_next_cache_planner_test.go`. Set
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CACHE_MANIFEST_CHECK=1`, an absolute
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST`, the selected
`DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_MODEL_PATH`, and a source-verified
`DARKBLOOM_PROMPT_SIDECAR_BINARY`. The manifest contains `model_id`,
`model_type`, `model_aggregate_sha256` and the complete integrity-file `files`
array (`path`, `role`, `size_bytes`, `sha256`), including weights and video
processor metadata. Provisioning checks that full aggregate but downloads only
prompt-role files. The planner check starts only the Rust sidecar, not MLX:

```bash
go test ./e2e -count=1 -run '^TestFlashNextCache(ManifestProvisioning|PlannerBindings)$'
```

After that preflight, an owned maintenance wrapper may select
`DARKBLOOM_FLASH_NEXT_CACHE_SCOPE=1` and run
`TestIntegration_FlashNextCacheScope` in `e2e/flash_next_cache_scope_test.go`,
with the same model/binary/output/MTP bindings described above. It recomputes
the actual loaded model identity, binds the local catalog's weight hash, and
compares two authenticated synthetic accounts with identical caller cache
labels. Retain native drain checks, HTTP equivalence and accepted SSD receipts
for both `off` and `auto`. Sidecar outage and re-preload are separate from
provider-process restart: the ordinary testbed stop helper deletes its temporary
cache directory and cannot establish persistence. These fixtures do not qualify
multi-host routing, signed key durability, raw logits or hosted account trust.

The cache fixture also compares consumer-visible cached/reasoning counts with
the native terminal (`e2e/flash_next_cache_usage_test.go`); observed SSD activity
alone cannot pass this check. `TestStreamingCombinedFinishUsage` in
`coordinator/tests/api/inference/chat_combined_terminal_usage_test.go` covers combined and
separate terminal shapes, absent usage, untrusted cache details, unchanged
totals/content, public identity, signature pairing and a single `[DONE]`.

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s scripts/qwen38_conversion -p 'test_qwen38_provenance.py' -v
go test ./coordinator/tests/protocol ./coordinator/tests/registry/...
swift test --package-path provider-swift --filter Qwen4SupportPolicyTests
```

The conversion suite uses synthetic files and a stub quantizer/serializer; it
does not execute MLX or establish numerical conversion parity. Provider source
coverage also includes `Qwen4EmbeddedMTPTests`, `Qwen4FactorySelectionTests`,
`Qwen4ExpMmapFootprintTests`, `Qwen4ReasoningControlTests` and Foundation
`Qwen4MediaPolicyTests`. Run relevant tests without skips after the matching
resources/build are available; a syntax-only SDK pass is not a unit-suite pass.

For actual model qualification, keep PLE enabled and bind every result to one
source/dependency/binary/metallib/artifact tuple:

1. Exercise the real default standalone load guard before weights, qualified
   identity and same-type/name-collision negatives, reservation cleanup, then
   ordinary cold CLI first generation and unload/reload. Exercise the coordinator
   path independently; a preloaded engine or listing is not cold-start evidence.
2. Compare target-only with actual embedded MTP on native paging, prefix cache
   off: target/state/output checks, widths and output boundaries, rejection and
   rollback, PLE first-use/sparse-threshold crossing and exact row gathers.
3. Turn complete prefix caching on separately: cold miss, hot repeat, real suffix,
   SSD-only file-read restore, mixed hit/miss, signed persistent restart,
   tenant/model/template/numerical identity and corrupt/stale-state rejection.
   Confirm native dtypes, ownership and truthful cached-token accounting.
4. Cover disconnect versus legal half-close, cancellation during prefill/decode/
   cache I/O, readmission, model switches, pressure and actual admitted concurrency.
   Check Chat/Responses reasoning/tools/usage/finish behavior and capability-bound
   media acceptance/rejection. Preserve failed cells and distinguish natural stops from full output
   budget tests. Speed targets remain deferred.

## App Attest validation

The [App Attest shadow validation commands](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#validation) cover cryptography, protocol symmetry, counter races, unchanged routing, and coexistence signing. Live macOS 27 acceptance remains separate.

## Cache attempt ownership during model replacement

Run the real Registry publication/accounting regression after changing model
inventory or attempt retention:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/registry \
  -run '^TestCacheModelSwitchPreservesOrRevokesPublishedOwnership$' -count=1
```

It first proves a durable holder and charged completed attempts, then exercises a
settled model-list replacement. Validation-only must not mutate either state.
An unchanged model/hash retains legitimate delayed publication. Removal or weight
replacement refunds retained attempt ownership and removes holders. Re-adding
the original model/capability must still reject the old nonce specifically as an
unavailable attempt, not merely because a capability is absent. The gate has three
scenario leaves and does not load a model or substitute for provider/API tests.

The provider email command and Resend adapter tests run with
`go test -race ./coordinator/tests/provideremail/... ./coordinator/tests/cmd/provider-emails/...`.
With a disposable `DATABASE_URL`, `TestReadSnapshotPostgres` uses an isolated
schema to verify owner changes, merged identities, delayed first captures and
unknown-registration exclusions. Registration capture and immutable-origin tests
run with `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/appattest/service ./coordinator/tests/registry -run 'TestInventoryCapture|TestConnectionOriginTime|TestProviderRegisteredAt'`.
API contract tests use a local HTTP server; they pin broadcast `reply_to` arrays
and pagination through `GET /segments/{id}/contacts`. No tests send live email. The
[provider email runbook](../operations/provider-emails.md) separates live
self-addressed delivery verification from these checks.


Withdrawal funding regressions run in `coordinator/tests/api/billing/contracts/stripe_withdrawal_queue_test.go`, `coordinator/tests/api/billing/contracts/stripe_withdrawal_queue_fairness_test.go`, `coordinator/tests/api/billing/payouts/global_payouts_queue_test.go` and `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/withdrawal_funding_queue_test.go`. Run the billing API and store contract packages; set `DATABASE_URL` to a disposable PostgreSQL database for both-backend coverage. Tests verify single reservation, concurrent claims, funding recovery, refreshed FX quotes, unknown-outcome retention and queued-money erasure guards. `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/global_payouts_window_test.go` covers posted readback and erasure protection after long funding waits, the exact return-window boundary, minute eligibility and active leases, plus legacy missing and zero JSON dispatch timestamps. UI copy tests cover the queued success and history states. `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/withdrawal_funding_migration_test.go` verifies adoption of an existing schema preserves queued records and records the migration once; the migration timeout suite includes the queued reconciliation index. Run the full PostgreSQL store package with the disposable database to cover replay fixtures as well as fresh/legacy upgrades. `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/stripe_withdrawal_state_age_test.go` verifies stuck filtering and sweep ordering before batch caps, and `coordinator/tests/api/billing/contracts/global_payouts_funding_expiry_test.go` verifies renewal when Stripe returns an FX object without a lock expiry. The funding queue contracts also cover progress beyond a full 200-row unavailable cohort, no-send retry bookkeeping, stale claim fences and recovery after rejected proof writes.


`e2e/testbed/profile/profile_test.go` (`TestProfilerDiff`) supplies explicit segment-duration events through `EventBuffer` and `Profiler` for deterministic mean/P95 comparisons. This verifies exact deltas without assuming that a longer timer sleep always measures longer on a busy CI runner; the profiler lifecycle tests retain real instrumentation coverage.

## Prerequisites

- Toolchain from [build.md](build.md) (`mise install`, submodules, `cmake`).
- **Postgres 16** for the coordinator store tests and the e2e suite: either
  Docker (`postgres:16` image is pulled automatically by the testbed) or a
  native `postgres`/`initdb` on `PATH` (`brew install postgresql@16`, then
  `PATH="$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin:$PATH"`). The testbed prefers
  Docker when `docker` is on `PATH` (`e2e/testbed/deps/postgres.go`,
  `PostgresLifecycle.Start`).
- **Hugging Face cache** with the e2e checkpoints:
  `mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8` (~12.1 GB, default testbed model),
  `mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit` (~14.5 GB, second model for
  multi-model suites), and `mlx-community/gemma-4-e2b-it-4bit` (exact-cache
  routing test). CI pins revisions `GPT_OSS_REVISION` /
  `EXACT_CACHE_MODEL_REVISION` in `.github/workflows/integration.yml`.
  The exact-cache suite explicitly selects `PrefixCacheMode: "ssd"`: this
  development checkpoint is outside the default-on catalog. Ephemeral cache
  keys only isolate storage and do not enable caching. The first request verifies
  `skipped_novel`; a second cold request establishes repeat demand and donates
  the checkpoint before the test asserts positive cached-token usage.
- `golangci-lint` v2.1.6 for the lint job
  (`go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.1.6`;
  config in `.golangci.yml`).

## Steps

### 1. Run everything CI runs as unit tests

```bash
make test   # coordinator-test prompt-sidecar-test provider-test ui-test benchmark-wrapper-test docs-check
```

### 2. Coordinator (Go)

For Open Sales Program changes, run the referral HTTP/service, consumer settlement,
and cross-backend contracts from the repository root:

```bash
go test ./coordinator/tests/api/billing/... ./coordinator/tests/billing/... ./coordinator/tests/api/inference/... ./coordinator/tests/store/... -run 'Referral|ConsumerCharge|ConsumerSettlement'
```

`coordinator/tests/internal/testkit/billing.go` (`NewBilling`) supplies isolated
mock billing and a funded consumer; it does not set a configurable referral rate.
Use the real composed router with locally signed Privy sessions for referral
mutations, and verify that API keys cannot register or apply a code. Store
contracts exercise atomic collected-spend rewards and paid-only promotion rewards
on memory and disposable PostgreSQL backends. Follow the database isolation
requirements below; no production credentials or databases are permitted.

The Go module lives at the repository root. Run `go test ./coordinator/...`
there to select coordinator packages; keep component `cd` commands in separate
shells when following the repository README examples.

Run prediction telemetry checks from the repository root:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/api/... ./coordinator/tests/registry/... ./coordinator/tests/protocol ./coordinator/tests/store/...
```

API fixtures use isolated encrypted WebSocket providers;
Postgres tests require an explicitly disposable `DATABASE_URL`, a local role
with `CREATEDB`, and include an
upgrade from the old profile schema. See
[prediction telemetry](../reference/prediction-decision-telemetry.md).

`coordinator/tests/api/inference/first_byte_attribution_test.go` holds the registry write lock while primary
and backup dispatches capture their serving-slot metrics. The encrypted
WebSocket test in `coordinator/tests/api/inference/contracts/first_byte_lock_test.go` separately requires the first
content to reach the HTTP client while that lock stays held. Run both with
`go test -race ./coordinator/tests/api/... -run 'TestServingSlotAttribution|TestFirstByteReachesClient' -count=25`.

The [admission calibration baseline](../reports/2026-09-06-admission-calibration-baseline.md)
records the original `TestTTFTPendingPrompt` comparison. On the current layout,
run `go test ./coordinator/tests/registry/... ./coordinator/tests/api/... -run TestTTFTPendingPrompt -count=1 -v`.
Its registry
cases exercise preflight, reservation, retained-plan revalidation and retained
output capacity. The HTTP cases cover both a feasible alternative behind a
long pending prompt and a long arrival completing behind a short pending prompt.
They use a real isolated coordinator and encrypted WebSocket providers with
scripted compute. It does not require model downloads or production access.

The CI formatting step checks tracked Go files with `gofmt`. It excludes
`docs/reports/evidence/`, whose captured source bytes are immutable and bound
by evidence manifests. Live Go source remains subject to the formatting gate.

`TestCacheIndexConcurrentTrackerOperations` in
`coordinator/tests/registry/cache_index_invariant_test.go` races tracker operations
with a bounded fake-clock advance while new lookup/ready transactions finish,
then expires the late holders while the workers remain active. The initial
advance already expires the old holders. Deferred worker shutdown also runs on
fatal assertions, preventing leaked background allocations from contaminating
`TestReserveProviderExAllocBudget`. The production TTLs, receipt acceptance,
index invariants and allocation ceiling are unchanged.

```bash
make coordinator-test                      # runner guards + complete coordinator suite
# what CI runs (repo root, race detector, Postgres-backed store tests included):
DATABASE_URL='postgres://testbed:testbed@127.0.0.1:5432/testbed?sslmode=disable' \
  python3 scripts/run-coordinator-tests.py --race --coverprofile coverage.out \
    $(go list ./... | grep -vx 'github.com/eigeninference/d-inference/e2e')
# coordinator packages only, as CI reports it:
scripts/coordinator-statement-coverage.sh coverage.out coverage-coordinator.out   # total statement coverage
gofmt -l .                                 # must print nothing
golangci-lint run                          # .golangci.yml
```

`TestReserveProviderExSnapshotAgeAndPending` in
`coordinator/tests/registry/routing_context_test.go` bounds each heartbeat age
by the scan or commit interval that produced it. Its preparation fixture also
refreshes the heartbeat between those phases, checking that candidate summaries
retain the scan evidence while the winner uses fresh commit evidence. The test
preserves the pre-debit pending-count assertions and uses no sleeps or fixed
elapsed-time tolerance. Repeat it with:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/registry -run '^TestReserveProviderExSnapshotAgeAndPending$' -count=1000
```

CI writes a coverage table to the job summary and keeps the full
`coverage.out` for 14 days as the `coordinator-coverage` artifact. The table
has the columns Component, Statements or Lines, Regions or Branches, Functions
and Target. The target is 80% and is for information only: a low number does
not fail the job. The step fails only when the profile has no coordinator data
or no total. The denominator is the statements in the `coordinator/...`
production packages. The runner instruments them in every test binary with
`-coverpkg`, so the tests in `coordinator/tests/` credit the production code
they run. A production package that no test imports still counts, at 0%. The
`coordinator/tests/...` packages and their helpers are not instrumented, and
`_test.go` files never count. The profile also holds `e2e/testbed/...` and a
frozen docs evidence package; the step leaves them out. `go test` has no
branch counters, so the table reports statements only. The table appears only
when the [component router](#component-ci-routing) runs the job; pushes to the
default branch always run it.

The runner compiles each selected large API test package once and discovers its
tests, examples, and fuzz seeds from that binary: `coordinator/tests/api`, its
`inference` and `inference/contracts` packages, and `provider/trust` and
`provider/contracts`. Race-enabled runs also compile and shard
`coordinator/tests/registry`; ordinary runs leave registry in one package process to
preserve its host-throughput guards. Each sharded package's complete list runs
in eight process-isolated shards with four workers by default. Other selected
packages run through ordinary `go test` while shard binaries compile, and
registry shards enter the worker queue before API compilation. No test
allowlist, test-result cache, shortened production timeout, or disabled race
detector is used. Shared environment and package-global fixtures remain isolated
between shards; tests within each shard keep Go's normal parallelism.

All coordinator Go tests belong in the mirrored `coordinator/tests/` tree.
Production packages must contain no `_test.go` files or imports of test infrastructure.
Tests import ordinary production packages; no overlay or copied implementation
is used. Place tests by the behavior they exercise:

| Test boundary | Location and fixture |
|---|---|
| Public HTTP/WebSocket contracts | `coordinator/tests/api/<domain>/contracts/`; use the real composed `api.Server.Handler()` router, in-memory store and scripted local providers through `coordinator/tests/internal/testkit/server.go` (`New`, `NewServer`). Domains include access, accounts, billing, catalog, inference, operations, provider, releases and reporting. |
| Domain invariants | `coordinator/tests/<owner>/`; retain constructor dependencies in fixtures or test a cohesive production component under `coordinator/internal/`. Do not add raw-state getters, test hooks or arbitrary exports solely to relocate assertions. |
| Pure request/response behavior | `coordinator/tests/api/inference/request/` and `coordinator/tests/api/inference/response/`; preserve parser, normalization, metadata, emitter and benchmark coverage independently of the router. |
| Composition and global middleware | `coordinator/tests/api/`: configuration/owner wiring, release-policy propagation, request identity and recovery middleware. |
| Backend conformance | `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/`; backend-specific invariants in `coordinator/tests/store/memory/` and `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/`. |

Provider heartbeat telemetry and inventory write-failure tests construct the
production components directly in explicit component fixtures. They do not
embed a provider owner with separately constructed heartbeat or inventory fields.
Owner/session wiring is tested through the real `/ws/provider` transport:
`coordinator/tests/api/provider/contracts/heartbeat_wiring_test.go`
(`TestProviderHeartbeatSessionUsesLiveRegistryAndObservation`) requires the live
registry update and emitted telemetry after an ordered drain barrier;
`coordinator/tests/api/provider/contracts/provider_models_replace_test.go`
(`TestProviderModelsReplaceUsesSameDrainedConnection`) checks inventory replacement
and readiness on that same connection. Component benchmark names, workloads and
allocation reporting remain unchanged; they do not claim to measure owner wiring.

Authenticated contract fixtures use `coordinator/tests/internal/testkit/auth.go`
(`NewSessions`, `Sessions.Token`) to sign local ES256 Privy-compatible JWTs and
seed users before authentication. They run the real verifier with a local public
key, without remote Privy user or JWKS calls. A package move must preserve every
assertion and must not substitute direct handler calls for a public router test.

Tests that run the coordinator in the test process (`app.Run` or the command
`Main`) get their listen port from `coordinator/tests/internal/testkit/listen_port.go`
(`FreeListenPort`). The coordinator exits the process on a bind error, so the
helper picks a free port below the macOS and Linux ephemeral port ranges.

`coordinator/tests/layout_test.go` (`TestCoordinatorTestsAreIsolated`) rejects
test files outside the mirror and production imports of `testing` or test helpers.
The offline runner/hook guards in `scripts/test-coordinator-tests.py` also run
the actual pre-push hook against local stub tools: standard
`go test ./coordinator/...` discovery must select the complete mirror, and a
Go test failure must block the push. These guards are not runtime test passes.
`coordinator/tests/api/source_layout_test.go` (`TestAPISourceFilesHaveDeclarations`)
parses the API, extracted internal components and API tests, rejecting
declaration-free shells. It skips `testdata` directories and permits `doc.go`.
Use `./coordinator/tests/api/...` from the repository root (or `./tests/api/...`
from `coordinator/`) for all API tests. Ordinary `go test ./coordinator/...` still
discovers the whole suite; testing `./coordinator/api` alone tests no mirrored suites.

Use `--jobs 1` for one process per sharded package, or use ordinary focused Go commands
such as `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/api/... -run '^TestRequestOutcome' -count=1`.
Keep an unsharded race/shuffle run when changing shared fixtures or the runner;
shards do not preserve cross-test process state. `GOMAXPROCS` is inherited rather
than forced to one. Store tests are never partitioned within their package.

`--output-dir <directory>` retains a unique run directory containing the exact
shard membership, per-task JSON events, stderr, compilation/listing timings,
and optional coverage. Every discovered test must produce exactly one terminal
result; a missing, duplicate,
unexpected, or failing result fails the run. Coverage merges atomic counters by
source block, retaining zero-hit blocks and counting their statements once.
With coverage enabled, all binaries use the same selected production-package
instrumentation. Mirrored test selections also include coordinator production
packages in `-coverpkg`, even when only a test package was requested. The entire
test tree, including testkit and test-database plumbing, is excluded from coverage.
Malformed or missing coverage fails the run rather than publishing a partial
success. CI uploads test evidence as `coordinator-test-timings` for 14 days.
The separate uninstrumented adversarial-number parser check still runs in CI.
CI uses a 16-vCPU Linux runner with eight workers (sixteen shards per package),
sharing the worker pool with the ordinary package task. Compilation and Go's
internal package parallelism are separate from this task limit.
The local default remains four workers; use `--jobs` to choose process concurrency.

Fixture speedups must retain the event being tested. Synchronous request-outcome
tests drain the real sink before asserting; `TestRequestOutcomeSinkPeriodicFlush`
separately checks the unchanged 100ms flush using virtual time.
`TestStreamingChatMissingCompletionUsesBoundedFallback` similarly preserves the
two-second missing-usage fallback without delaying ordinary signature tests. Failover providers
wait for the registration's `desired_models` frame rather than sleeping. The
crash fixture observes active streams and queued work before disconnecting, then
requires server-side error/queue-timeout completion, not a client timeout.

`TestProfile_RequestProfilesRecorded` checks that the stored transport estimate
matches the difference of coordinator and provider spans. Negative values remain
valid observations; this is not a direct nonnegative network-latency measurement.
The focused `TestApplyProviderProfileTransportEstimateArithmetic` regression covers
positive, negative and missing operands in
`coordinator/tests/api/observation/profiler_provider_test.go`.

Store tests that need Postgres skip themselves when `DATABASE_URL` is unset.
`coordinator/tests/internal/testdb/main.go` (`Main`) creates and later drops a
distinct temporary database for each test process; per-test truncation stays
within that database. The configured database is used only for administration,
not migrated or truncated. The connection role therefore needs `CREATEDB`.
Database isolation alone does not isolate PostgreSQL's connection budget:
`acquireServerBudget` holds a session advisory lock on the administrative
database for the test process, serializing participating store suites that use
that same database. This keeps their production-sized pools compatible with a
default 100-connection PostgreSQL server without raising its limit. Closing the
administrative connection releases the lock, including on process exit; tests
within each process remain sequential because their fixtures truncate tables.
`coordinator/tests/internal/testdb/main_test.go`
(`TestServerBudgetSerializesIndependentConnections`,
`TestIsolatedURLCannotSelectConfiguredDatabase`) pins lock ownership and URL
isolation, including database query-parameter overrides. Coordinator command
maintenance tests use the same per-process disposable database and server-budget
admission through `coordinator/tests/cmd/coordinator/main_test.go` (`TestMain`,
`testdb.Main`); inheriting `DATABASE_URL` does not authorize those tests to mutate
the configured database. CI provides a
`postgres:16` service with user/password/db `testbed`, and runs
`make sqlc-check` against it after the tests. The pre-push hook is not
a substitute for the complete coordinator runner and explicit race/database
validation; run the full set before merging.

#### Idle-provider routing recovery

The routing regression suites use real registry reservations, injected
measurement histories and virtual-clock heartbeat feedback. Run the focused
selection and two-hour starvation simulations before the complete coordinator
suite:

```bash
go test ./coordinator/tests/registry ./coordinator/tests/registry/routingsim \
  -run 'TestIdleDecode|TestExploredIdleProvider|TestClosedLoop' -count=1
```

The simulation's idle-wait bound applies to its fixed fleet and arrival schedule;
it is not a promise that every production provider receives traffic. Keep the
exploration-backoff and inference-outcome tests in the full suite as well:
recovering an idle provider must not repeatedly select a genuinely slow one.
All tests stay under `coordinator/tests/`; no live coordinator or provider model
is needed for these routing checks.

#### Offline OpenRouter caller conformance

Scenarios, fixtures and observers live in `coordinator/tests/internal/conformance/`.
The thin `coordinator/tests/api/inference/contracts/openrouter_conformance_test.go`
adapter (`conformanceSuite`) retains the existing 22 test entry points. It binds
the real composed runtime together with the ledger and reservation controller it
constructs, without adding production exports; the outstanding service hold is
measured at that controller's admission boundary, not read from private state, by
`coordinator/tests/internal/conformance/service_hold.go` (`OutstandingServiceHold`).
Run the inference contract tests below: the support package is not itself a
test entry point and is not imported by production.
Streaming providers emit the concrete build ID; the HTTP assertions require
the caller's alias, so bypassing the coordinator's model rewrite fails.
Current-wire fixtures send typed `invalid_request` errors and use explicit
template readiness for the unsupported-tool fence; they do not reintroduce
upstream's retired version-based tool heuristic. The test-support package
also exposes shared fixture helpers for the separate composed cache tests.

`TestOpenRouterConformance` exercises `Server.Handler` with synthetic catalog
records, account-owned API keys, memory storage and encrypted loopback provider
WebSockets. It needs Go and no provider binary, model, database or external account.
Use the repository-pinned Go toolchain. Prepare module dependencies separately
in dedicated `GOMODCACHE`, `GOCACHE` and `GOTMPDIR` directories before the offline
run; leave `HOME` unchanged. Clear inherited service, database, authentication,
telemetry and proxy variables from the test process environment.

From the repository root, with those isolated caches prepared:

```bash
GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOENV=off GOMAXPROCS=2 \
  go test -p 1 ./coordinator/tests/api/inference/contracts -json -count=1 -timeout=3m \
  -run '^TestOpenRouterConformance' > conformance.jsonl
GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOENV=off GOMAXPROCS=2 \
  go test -p 1 ./coordinator/tests/api/inference/contracts -race -json -count=1 -timeout=5m \
  -run '^TestOpenRouterConformance' > conformance-race.jsonl
```

Require nonzero execution of Auth, Feed, Chat, AccountSLA, Drain, Retry,
PostContentFailure, ClientError, Cancellation, CompletionFirst, Tools, Observer
and Transport under that prefix. The incident and readiness additions also require
IncidentProvenance, IncidentEnvelope, IncidentRefusal, Scenario,
ScenarioFragmentation, ScenarioBounds, ScenarioChoiceShape, ReadinessFeed and
ReadinessCapabilities. Retain every failure and unexpected skip across all
22 groups. The combined family has 197 leaf cases, 64 of them in the thirteen
groups named first. `OR_REPORT` log lines contain bounded synthetic status, attempts,
terminal, timing, usage and balance evidence.
Repeat with `-count=2` to compare semantic fields, excluding timing values;
assert generated identities within each request before normalizing reports.

The observer measures headers at `Client.Do` return, then first complete event,
semantic payload and terminal while consuming the body. Role, usage and DONE
are not semantic output; unavailable timing is null. It rejects malformed or
truncated events, in-band errors, missing or duplicate DONE, changed identity,
trailing payload and read errors. A provider drain acknowledgement joins prior
completion workers before duplicate-terminal and no-stray-cancel assertions.
The transport permits only its fixture address and rejects redirects and proxies.

The OpenRouter cancellation fixture observes the existing completed-write profile
stamp before canceling a dispatched request. Receiving provider bytes alone does
not prove that the writer has finished; cancellation during an in-flight write
may correctly abort that connection. Registry writer tests cover that separate
outcome, while this fixture continues to require a matching cancel frame and
exact settlement cleanup.

The incident-envelope and scenario cases preserve the two curated Boston weather
requests with reasoning disabled and tool choice omitted or auto. Added model
identity is an explicit synthetic fixture wrapper. They check the complete
forwarded schema/control fields and distinguish transport validity from the
expected function, arguments, call IDs, indexes, cardinality and finish reason.
A well-formed refusal ending in `stop` fails the weather scenario even when
transport succeeds; a correct authored call may retain permitted pre-call text.
These scripts do not prove actual Nemotron tool selection or native prompt parity.

Readiness cases use authenticated metadata registration and normal `models_update`
WebSocket messages to check staged/ready/staged feed visibility and capability
enable/revoke, legacy omission, hash rejection and wrong-model fencing. A feed
flag or advertised capability does not establish actual model loading or serving.
`OR_INCIDENT`, `OR_SCENARIO` and `OR_READINESS` log records state these limits.

These tests qualify the authored HTTP/transport and memory-accounting fixtures.
Test-only trust and capacity state are explicit; tool declarations are synthetic.
Real-model qualification and hosted OpenRouter qualification are not run by this
command. Synthetic timings do not measure production latency, and no live request,
model download or provider operation follows from an offline pass.

#### Coordinator startup and reconnect recovery

`TestSupervisorRestartsChildAndBecomesReady` allows a five-second helper startup
and a fifteen-second overall wait so concurrent cold builds do not exhaust its
restart budget. It asserts restart plus readiness, not a production startup SLA;
production supervisor deadlines are unchanged (`coordinator/tests/promptcontract/supervisor_test.go`).

The [startup observer](../operations/coordinator-startup-measurement.md) has
standard-library tests using only local HTTP stubs and a deterministic clock.
They run in Release Integrity CI and make no external inference calls:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/startup_measurement -t scripts -p 'test_*.py'
```


Use a disposable local PostgreSQL database for the startup regressions. Store
tests truncate tables and create/drop isolated databases; never point
`DATABASE_URL` at a shared or production database.

```bash
cd coordinator
# DATABASE_URL must name a throwaway local database.
go test -p 1 ./tests/store/... ./tests/cmd/coordinator -run 'Test(FreshDatabaseSchema|RecordProviderEarningMaintains|BaseRewardEarningPaths|ProviderEarningsJobIndex|ProviderRestore|PostgresRestore|ProviderAndReputation|Maintenance)' -count=1
go test -race ./tests/api/... ./tests/registry/... -run 'Test(ProviderRestore|ProviderPendingRestore|RestoreProviderState|AttachCachedMDAProof|StageDurableMDAChain)' -count=1
```

These check that a fresh database gets the withdrawable balance column and the
usage-totals counter row, live summary maintenance without double-counting a
retried job, base-reward work exclusion, a repeated boot while earnings history
is exclusively locked,
concurrent reconnect exclusion, late initial/reputation-write ordering, atomic
provider/reputation publication and rollback, and newest-prior
identity lookup through CachedStore,
index applicability, MDA trust caps, and a migration-only subprocess that exits
without HTTP startup or admin-key seeding. They do not measure production startup
latency or validate an overlapping coordinator handoff.

Goose startup, upgrade and advisory-lock tests live in
`coordinator/tests/store/postgres/migrations_test.go`. Concurrent-index snapshot
waits, invalid-leftover recovery and failed-version recording live in
`coordinator/tests/store/postgres/migration_index_test.go`. Run the
[migration verification commands](database-migrations.md#verify) with the same
disposable database.

Startup recovery regressions also cover catalog-verified index definitions and isolated
planner applicability, transient provider/reputation retries, a shared deadline,
1013 registration teardown before duplicate eviction, and routing/capacity/load
exclusion while a verified identity is restoring. Tests use disposable stores and
localhost WebSockets (`coordinator/tests/api/provider/restore_retry_test.go`
for transient reads, deadlines and disconnects;
`coordinator/tests/api/provider/contracts/restore_retry_test.go`
for registration teardown before duplicate eviction;
`coordinator/tests/registry/provider_restore_routing_test.go`); they do not reconnect production providers.

### 3. Prompt-contract sidecar (Rust)

#### Per-contract readiness and real Go/Rust pairing

The merged preload lifecycle fixtures use the controller's current client
contract and keep a closed controller closed even if Start is called later.
An empty verified set remains unavailable; metrics timing is tested with an
acknowledged nonempty set, and in-flight generation changes discard publication.
Active-set fixtures hand off coherent verified model identities and assert
bounded selection/failure reasons rather than exposing transport errors.

The Go `TestPreload*` unit tests cover healthy members beside unrelated pending
or failed artifacts, strict partial reports, fresh runtime readiness, retry
backoff, exact verified-set changes, catalog/child generation fences and public
controller close. Run them under the race detector from the repository root:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/promptcontract -run '^TestPreload' -count=1
```

`TestPreloadRealSidecarRuntimeAndMixedVersions` and
`TestPreloadRealSidecarGenerationAndCanceledResponseDrain` are opt-in real Unix
HTTP tests in `coordinator/tests/promptcontract/preload_real_sidecar_test.go`. Without
explicit actual binary bindings they skip; unit-test success is not their
execution evidence. They provision tiny hash-verified local tokenizer fixtures,
run real supervised Rust children, and use actual preload/health/ready/metrics/
plan responses. Only artifact downloads are fixture-local. A held control call
or response does not fabricate readiness.

Before running the real pairing, bind each candidate and legacy **service**
executable to its compiler-artifact and source receipt. The artifact must be the
`promptsidecar` bin target, not a libtest executable; a role environment label
or different executable hashes alone does not prove version provenance. Provide:

| Variable | Binding |
| --- | --- |
| `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR` / `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR_SHA256` | Canonical absolute candidate service path and exact SHA-256 |
| `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR_LEGACY` / `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR_LEGACY_SHA256` | Independently source-bound legacy service path and exact SHA-256 |
| `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_GO_VERSION` | `candidate` or `legacy`, matching the actual compiled Go source/overlay receipt |
| `DARKBLOOM_PLANNING_TEST_UDS_PARENT` | Existing allocated canonical short private directory; the fixture owns a child leaf |

Run both Go versions with the same compatible test file and preserve exact
source/overlay provenance, binary hashes, starts/terminals and fixture inventory.
Use a sanitized environment and an outer deadline/owned-process-group cleanup;
Darwin does not supply the Linux parent-death guarantee. The fixture itself
checks binary hashes before/after use, closes its real children and checks
socket disappearance. No production credentials, signing, downloads, provider
service or model weights are required.

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/promptcontract -run '^TestPreloadRealSidecar' -count=1 -timeout=3m
```

The pairing distinguishes strict degraded reports from usable runtime subsets,
checks old/new role behavior, catalog replacement and actual child restart.
Its held-response cancellation case proves that Go cannot publish a canceled
real response after Rust loaded it; it does **not** prove cancellation of a
blocking Rust loader. That ownership gate belongs to the Rust tests below.

`TestCachePlanningRealSidecarHealthyMemberHTTP`
(`coordinator/tests/api/inference/cache_planning_partial_real_test.go`) extends the existing API
fixture with a real Rust service and an encrypted synthetic provider. Its two
subtests, `failed_tokenizer` and `pending_artifact`, each exercise healthy A and
unready B through four endpoints in streaming and non-streaming modes: 32 HTTP
cells, not 32 separate Go test cases. The default synthetic-sidecar fixture is
unchanged when this opt-in is not selected.

Bind the candidate service and actual Go source as above, setting
`DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR`, `DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_SIDECAR_SHA256`,
`DARKBLOOM_TEST_PROMPT_GO_VERSION=candidate` and
`DARKBLOOM_PLANNING_TEST_UDS_PARENT`. This gate needs no legacy service binding.
An absent candidate binary skips it; preserve explicit no-skip execution evidence.
From the repository root, with the same sanitized environment and outer owned
process cleanup described above:

```bash
go test ./coordinator/tests/api/inference -run '^TestCachePlanningRealSidecarHealthyMemberHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=3m
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/api/inference -run '^TestCachePlanningRealSidecarHealthyMemberHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=3m
```

The test compares actual Rust plan counters before and after each request,
requires one encrypted correlated dispatch, unique V2 attempt nonces for A and
cold dispatch metadata for B, and checks consumer content/terminals and owner
drain. Each condition has a 40-second request context; the real fixture has a
45-second lifecycle/download bound and retains the existing two-second planning
timeout. The outer three-minute test watchdog is not a serving-budget increase.
Synthetic provider output and usage do not establish model quality, native KV
adoption, cache hits, billing accuracy or end-to-end performance.

Rust's library `planner::readiness::tests` and `planner::readiness_tests` cover
operation-drop/panic, generation and poison fences, exclusive replacement,
post-permit membership, and cancellation while waiting or running blocking
loads. `tests/per_contract_readiness.rs` covers partial/all-failed replacement,
removed-but-cached members, invalid requests, capacity and explicit managed
startup. Keep the existing
`preload_failure_gates_plans_until_active_set_recovers` planner fixture. Use
the normal all-target gate below; filtered runs must prove their exact named
tests executed, not merely compile or return zero selected tests.

Negotiated preload continuity has its own controls. Go preload controls cover
legacy fallback and fail-closed negotiated downgrade
(`TestPreloadContinuityNegotiationNeverSilentlyDowngrades` and
`TestPreloadStaleProtocolFailureWithdrawsSameChildAuthority`,
`coordinator/tests/promptcontract/preload_negotiation_test.go`) and a held retry
that keeps the acknowledged healthy member admitted
(`TestPreloadContinuityKeepsHealthyContractReadyDuringRetry`,
`coordinator/tests/promptcontract/preload_continuity_test.go`). The `^TestPreload`
filter above runs all three once; repeat them alone with:

```bash
go test -race ./coordinator/tests/promptcontract -count=3 -run \
  '^(TestPreloadContinuityKeepsHealthyContractReadyDuringRetry|TestPreloadContinuityNegotiationNeverSilentlyDowngrades|TestPreloadStaleProtocolFailureWithdrawsSameChildAuthority)$'
```

Rust planner controls hold actual blocking loaders and plan references through
cancellation and capacity pressure (`planner::readiness_tests::continuity`,
`coordinator/promptsidecar/src/planner/continuity_tests.rs`). These component
tests do not establish native MLX cache adoption, production throughput or
real-model hit rates.

These are tokenizer/readiness and ownership gates, not native KV adoption,
hosted routing, performance or release certification. Original request
deadlines, source/authentication checks and configured capacities remain in
force. Direct client and Rust over-capacity submissions still reject; the
controller selects a bounded set under the
[overflow policy](../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md#bounded-tokenizer-preload-selection).

#### Bounded preload selection and real HTTP overflow

`TestPreloadContinuityUnknownCompletionPreservesIncumbents` uses real control
transport EOF and a deterministic ten-contract/eight-slot rotation to check
repeated uncertain completion without losing acknowledged incumbents or
acknowledging newcomers. `TestCachePreloadIdentityProjectsLargeVerifiedCatalog`
and `TestCachePreloadConfiguredCatalogControllerFlow` cover 129 verified models
sharing eight contracts with one allowlisted model; selection retains the full
verified catalog without raising native capacity.

`coordinator/tests/promptcontract/preload_transport_uncertainty_test.go` uses the
actual Unix-socket client and controller to cover truncated/timed-out HTTP 200
bodies, readiness-probe failures after validated partial reports, and the next
capacity rotation. Completed malformed reports still withdraw authority; failed
members and unconfirmed newcomers never inherit an incumbent acknowledgement.
Run these with `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/promptcontract -count=3 -run
'TestPreloadContinuity(ResponseBodyFailure|ReadinessTimeout|ReadyFailure)'`.

`TestPreloadLongModelIDAuthenticatedRegistration`, `TestPreloadProvisionedLongModelID`
and `TestCachePreloadLongModelIDDoesNotPoisonCatalog` cover accepted 513-byte model
IDs through registration, actual artifact verification, Registry projection and
bounded selection. The short-model-only allowlist control proves an unrelated
accepted model cannot invalidate that model's preload selection. Oversized-ID
and existing explicit-allowlist rejection controls retain their bounds.


The pure `coordinator/tests/promptcontract/preload_active_set*_test.go` cases cover
full verified-set preservation, deduplication, eligible demand, expiry, residence,
fair waiting, failure backoff, same-generation verified-set growth and irreversible
in-flight ABA fencing. Controller tests additionally cover completed native
acknowledgement versus current participation, forced polls during partial-backoff
admissibility drift, capture-through-apply ordering, background-only advisory
refresh, HTTP 409 retirement and standalone tokenizer readiness without
authorization. API tests retain the original planning reason and sampling/QPS
assertions and check policy drift between classification and commitment. Use the
ordinary and race gates for `coordinator/tests/promptcontract`,
`coordinator/tests/registry` and `coordinator/tests/api/inference`; no pure
helper result substitutes for actual sidecar/HTTP qualification.

`TestPromptArtifactCapacityRealSidecarAndAuthenticatedNinth` uses the candidate
service path/hash and private UDS parent bindings above. Its two fixture files,
`coordinator/tests/api/inference/prompt_artifacts_capacity_fixture_test.go` and
`coordinator/tests/api/inference/prompt_artifacts_capacity_test.go`, use public lifecycle APIs
available on the old controller as well, so the same oracle can establish the
original whole-catalog refusal before qualifying a candidate. Preserve the exact
old/candidate Go trees and test overlay in the runner receipt; an intended red is
not a pass or a fixture failure.

The fixture verifies nine tiny local artifacts through Store, catalog and
Provisioner; first loads/plans all nine in legal direct Rust batches; and retains
both the Go and independent Rust nine-ID rejection controls at configured capacity
eight. Authenticated encrypted fake-provider HTTP requests supply demand. The
candidate must preload at most eight, return the cold ninth request without
waiting for residence, then eventually plan the demanded ninth without pruning
verification, raising capacity or restarting the child. A nine-model/eight-shared-
contract control must preserve full within-capacity behavior. The bounded residence
wait is intentional; allow the fixture's full cleanup deadline:

```bash
go test ./coordinator/tests/api/inference -run '^TestPromptArtifactCapacityRealSidecarAndAuthenticatedNinth$' -count=1 -timeout=4m
```

Keep `TestCachePlanningRealSidecarHealthyMemberHTTP` alongside that oracle. It
exercises the real healthy-subset path across four endpoints, streaming and
non-streaming, and pending/failed peers. These local tokenizer/planning tests do
not load a model, prove SSD adoption, measure a production hit rate or explain a
historical fleet percentage. Preserve passes, intended baseline failures, skips,
binary/source receipts and owned-child cleanup separately.

#### Simultaneous connected-cache restoration

After the source-matched B1 smoke, `TestIntegrationConnectedCacheBatching`
requires a serial reference followed by two simultaneous successful requests.
It checks actual native multirow processing, distinct encrypted dispatches and
terminals, output/finish/non-cache usage equality, and real SSD adoption rather
than inferring batching or reuse from configuration.

Prepare two immutable connected-input JSON files using the existing
`e2e/connected_cache_input_test.go` schema. Keep model, prompt, contract, binary
and resource hashes equal; set `max_concurrent: 2`, `backend: "paged"`,
`mtp_mode: "off"`, and change only `cache_mode` between `"off"` and `"ssd"`.
The fixture validates these settings and protects the existing host config.
Use a fresh nonexistent output path for each arm:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_BATCH_INPUT=/absolute/path/to/b2-ssd.json \
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_BATCH_OUTPUT=/absolute/path/to/new-owned-output \
go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheBatching$' -count=1 -timeout=15m -v
```

Require both workers to finish, the native slot to drain, no dropped relay
events, and two actual lookup/hit receipts in the SSD arm. Compare reports across
arms too, excluding only opaque request/tool IDs, chunk boundaries and the
intended cached-token discount; preserve reasoning and every other usage detail.
The equal-prompt B2 fixture is not arbitrary mixed-cohort or cross-host coverage.
Its test trust/billing and ephemeral cache keys are not production attestation or
persistent-Keychain restart.

The observer refusal controls run without a model:

```bash
go test -race ./e2e -run '^TestConnectedBatch' -count=1
```

They reject missing/duplicate/unencrypted dispatches, missing terminal adoption,
serial-only execution, malformed counts and changed non-cache usage details.
Source selectors and compilation alone are not an executed native B2 pass.

#### Rust component checks

```bash
make prompt-sidecar-format   # cargo fmt --all -- --check
make prompt-sidecar-check    # cargo check --locked --all-targets; cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
make prompt-sidecar-test     # cargo test --locked --all-targets
```

CI additionally builds the static Linux binary through the Dockerfile stage
(`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 --target prompt-sidecar-builder -f coordinator/Dockerfile .`),
checks `file` reports `statically linked|static-pie linked`, and replays the
production prompt vectors against it with
`scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh <binary>`.

CI then measures coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov` 0.9.1. It writes the same
table shape as the coordinator job: lines, regions and functions, with an 80%
report-only target, and it also appears only when the router runs the job.
The step reads each value by its field name from the JSON report and fails if
one is missing. A low number does not fail the job. The
denominator is `coordinator/promptsidecar/src`. The tests under `tests/`,
every `tests.rs` test module under `src/` and dependencies are left out;
inline unit-test modules inside other `src` files are counted. Branch counters
need a nightly toolchain, so branches are not reported. `cargo llvm-cov` runs
the sidecar tests a second time, with coverage instrumentation, so a test
failure can first appear in the Report coverage step. To measure it locally:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview --toolchain 1.88.0
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.9.1 --locked
cd coordinator/promptsidecar && cargo +1.88.0 llvm-cov --locked --all-targets --summary-only   # lines, regions, functions
```

A number measured on macOS can differ from the Linux number in CI.

#### Warm planner performance and template ownership

`planner_performance` is an ignored, local-artifact benchmark of the actual
renderer and tokenizer, rather than a synthetic word tokenizer. It downloads
nothing and calls no coordinator. Point `PROMPT_BENCH_MODEL_ROOT` at an immutable
model directory containing `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `config.json`
and `chat_template.jinja`; set `PROMPT_BENCH_MODEL_ID` to the concrete model ID.

```bash
cd coordinator/promptsidecar
PROMPT_BENCH_MODEL_ROOT=/absolute/isolated/model PROMPT_BENCH_MODEL_ID=concrete-model \
  cargo +1.88.0 test --locked --release --test planner_performance -- \
  --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Run the same fixture, artifact bytes and controls on both comparison revisions.
Separate short, tool-schema, long-prompt and synchronized burst cells; retain
sample counts, timing quantiles, allocation traffic and exact count/chain proof
fingerprints. Cumulative allocated bytes are not peak RSS, and local planner
timings do not establish production timeout or consumer TTFT improvements.
`render::prepared` and `planner::retention_tests` cover request-specific dates,
model filters, template variants, render bounds and release of compiled programs
when their bounded contract owner retires. Production and fixture projections
must retain identical exact count and block-chain results.


### 4. Provider (Swift) — unit tests with a source-matched metallib

CI also applies the [restored-resource cleanup](build.md#restored-swiftpm-runtime-resources)
before building the debug test product.

#### MiMo provider CI fixtures

Provider Tests provisions the pinned public prompt metadata and original corpus
with `scripts/prepare-mimo-prompt-fixtures.py`, exporting
`MIMO_PROMPT_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY` and `MIMO_PROMPT_REFERENCE_VECTORS` in that job.
These remain required for the routine tokenizer/prompt/consumer tests; a skip or
a fabricated recorded-divergence corpus is not a replacement.

`scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py` creates the separate synthetic
193-tensor, four-shard inventory offline. Its default is symmetric K32/V32,
128-context BF16; `--asymmetric` creates K64/V128 with 1,024 context for the
complete-prefix selectors. Both have three synthetic MTP heads and each shard is
below 1 MiB. No selected codec, model-quality oracle or payload-verification
receipt is generated. Prepare fresh directories before a local run:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare-mimo-prompt-fixtures.py --output /absolute/fresh/mimo-prompt
python3 scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py --output /absolute/fresh/mimo-provider
python3 scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py --output /absolute/fresh/mimo-prefix --asymmetric
export MIMO_PROMPT_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY=/absolute/fresh/mimo-prompt
export MIMO_PROMPT_REFERENCE_VECTORS="$PWD/fixtures/prompt-contract/mimo-v26-additional20.json"
export MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES=/absolute/fresh/mimo-provider
export MIMO_V26_WIRED_METADATA_FIXTURE=/absolute/fresh/mimo-provider/tiny-bf16
export MIMO_V26_PROVIDER_LIFETIME_METADATA_TESTS=1
```

After rebuilding tests and staging the source-matched metallib, the general
`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` invocation runs metadata, prompt and non-native
unit tests with `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS` unset. Its existing invocation
and isolated-test behavior remain unchanged. CI separately runs the following
small native gates in fresh serial processes; each uses
`scripts/run-nested-suite.sh` to reject zero executed tests and every skip:

```bash
cd provider-swift
MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1 ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh \
  'MiMoV26StandaloneLifecycleTests.test(ActualScannerPreloadStartsListenerWithSameNativeOwner|StartRefusesActualUnpublishedPreloadWithoutReplacingOwner)' --no-parallel
MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1 MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES=/absolute/fresh/mimo-prefix \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh 'MiMoV26NativeLoadTransactionTests.testNativeCompletePrefix' --no-parallel
MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1 MIMO_V26_PROVIDER_LIFETIME_NATIVE_TESTS=1 \
  MIMO_V26_PROVIDER_LIFETIME_FAULT_CASE=testNativeFenceRefusalKeepsActualBundlePermitAndBlocksOtherOwnerReclaim \
  DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0 DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY=0 \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh testNativeFenceRefusalKeepsActualBundlePermitAndBlocksOtherOwnerReclaim --no-parallel
MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1 MIMO_V26_PROVIDER_LIFETIME_NATIVE_TESTS=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0 DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY=0 \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh testGracefulDrainAfterServedRequestRetiresNativeOwnerWithinDeadline --no-parallel
```

The lifecycle drain gate serves one request through the real native owner, then
requires the graceful drain that `darkbloom restart` and `darkbloom stop` publish
to report `drained` within its deadline
(`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/ProviderLoop/MiMo/ProviderLoopNativeMiMoLifetimeTests.swift`).

Reserve the native lane before these commands. The retained-fault selector must
run alone and preserve its actual native owner until process exit. CI runs these
gates even after an unrelated test failure, provided fixture/build/metallib
prerequisites succeeded. Tiny-model control-flow passes do not qualify the full
selected checkpoint, paging composition or audio generation.

Native and selected-evidence tests skip only when their required opt-in is absent;
an invalid opt-in value or missing/malformed enabled fixture fails. Fault selectors
still deliberately isolate incompatible cases. `MiMoTestPrerequisitesTests`
pins absent/enabled/malformed opt-ins. Selected tests remain additional explicit
gates, not routine CI downloads:

| Gate | Opt-In And Required Inputs |
|---|---|
| Managed selected audio and combined prefix/media | `MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AUDIO_PROVIDER_TESTS=1`, `MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AUDIO_FIXTURE_ROOT`; native methods also require `MIMO_V26_SERIAL_NATIVE_TESTS=1`. The fixture must meet their own target/context constraints and retain the actual selected ~1.8 GB codec. |
| Selected discovery load quote | `MIMO_V26_DISCOVERY_AUDIO_TESTS=1`, `MIMO_V26_DISCOVERY_AUDIO_FIXTURE_ROOT`; actual selected target/sidecar metadata and inventory, not synthetic sizes. |
| Recorded normalization divergence | `MIMO_CONSUMER_DIVERGENCE_TESTS=1`, `MIMO_CONSUMER_DIVERGENCE_VECTORS`; the original external/private recorded corpus plus pinned prompt metadata. |
| Recorded audiovisual ingress | `MIMO_V26_INGRESS_AUDIO_VIDEO_TESTS=1`, `MIMO_V26_INGRESS_AUDIO_VIDEO_FIXTURE`; a bounded valid MP4 with an actual audio track, not synthetic track flags. |

The managed-audio retained-fault method additionally requires
`MIMO_V26_MANAGED_AUDIO_PROVIDER_FAULT_TEST=1` in its own process. Do not replace
missing selected files or recorded cases with synthetic evidence, download large
weights in routine CI, or loosen production admission/reserve defaults.
`python3 scripts/test-prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py` checks complete inventory,
offsets, bounded deterministic bytes, geometry, provenance and CI prerequisite
wiring offline; `python3 scripts/test-native-gpu-ci.py` checks runner isolation
without executing Swift or a GPU.
SDK 27 qualification uses the same prompt and symmetric metadata fixtures
before its watchdog-driven general provider pass; the shared action exports
them for that step without enabling native opt-ins.

`BetaCommandTests` and `IdleCommandTests` drive `setBetaFeature` and
`setIdleUnloadMinutes` with an explicit `configPath` in a unique temporary
directory. That directory is the only mutation and cleanup target; the tests
never create or remove the operator's canonical config. The mixed-mutation
fixture checks both explicit pins and unrelated settings. Run these with
`RuntimeSnapshotConfigTests` when changing
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ConfigMutation.swift` (`withMutableConfig`),
which loads the runtime snapshot, takes the sidecar lock, reloads and saves;
loading a config never migrates or rewrites it.

`WatchdogCommandTests` fails immediately if writing its temporary TOML fails.
Config-only assertions supply an empty environment to `Watchdog.settings`, while
the update opt-out case supplies `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` explicitly.
`LocalEndpointFileTests` checks its temporary-directory environment override and
restores the inherited `DARKBLOOM_LOCAL_DIR` value after each fixture. Run both
suites with `--no-parallel`; suite serialization alone does not isolate other
suites from process-wide environment changes.

`HiddenFileSkippingTest` includes hidden allowlisted weights and configuration,
so removing hidden-entry skipping changes the manifest. `TemplateRenderCheckTests`
uses templates that reject an incorrect BOS value for both tokenizer-config
forms and require the empty default when the config is absent.
`tamperFailsClosed` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheTests.swift`
keeps changed metadata valid JSON and requires
`SSDBlockStoreError.authenticationFailed` from the authenticated read; it
separately retains schema-validation rejection.
Run these after building and staging the test product as described below:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel \
  --filter 'HiddenFileSkippingTest|TemplateRenderCheckTests|tamperFailsClosed'
```

These fixtures use temporary files and an in-memory KEK. They do not exercise
model inference or a hardware-backed encryption key.

For SSD authentication and donation changes, run the filter
`SSDBlockStoreTests|SSDPrefixCacheLifecycleTests|SSDPrefixCacheReadyReceiptTests|SSDPrefixCacheDonationGateTests`
with `--no-parallel`. In `provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheTests.swift`,
`tamperFailsClosed` distinguishes valid metadata rejected by DEK authentication
from invalid schemas rejected by header parsing. `responsePathNotDelayed`
requires donation to return while maintenance is held; negative write and ready
checks await `waitForWritesForTesting` before inspecting the result. These use
temporary encrypted files and tiny MLX arrays, not a downloaded model.

The general provider suite passes `--no-parallel` explicitly to Swift Testing.
Unrelated cases share process-wide MLX state and executor capacity; overlapping
thousands of them can starve bounded test handshakes. Concurrency tests retain
their own tasks, barriers and interleavings. This does not serialize provider
inference or the separate model-concurrency benchmarks.

`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` runs each native allocator assertion, the
controlled ledger interleaving, the real process-environment projection test
and the SSD sidecar stage-deadline test in separate processes. The general
suite excludes those cases; each isolated invocation uses the existing
nonempty/no-skips guard.
A general-suite failure does not silence the isolated gates. Isolation keeps the
stage-deadline assertion at the production budget without unrelated suite load;
it does not change an assertion or runtime resource-selection rule.

The accepted-then-expired engine case also runs in a fresh process. Its controlled
engine admits before a real two-second deadline and returns after that deadline;
the original accepted/expired profiling and cancellation assertions remain. This
removes the former 30-second allowance for unrelated suite load, not a production
deadline. The shell runner sets `DARKBLOOM_ISOLATED_DEADLINE_TEST=1` only for that
isolated invocation. Direct/IDE runs retain the original 30-second setup margin.
It remains subject to the isolated nonempty/no-skips gate.

`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Tests/MLXLMTests/NativeBlockEngineTests.swift`
(`concurrentWaitingCancellationRetiresEveryGeneration`) stress-tests concurrent
cancellation across 2,048 submissions and requires every reservation to retire.
It does not deterministically schedule the cancellation race.
Separate cancellation reads for filtering and removal can orphan a queued
request; the regression protects the single-decision retirement/removal in
`CBv2NativeBlockEngine.pump`, not a larger timeout or an early reservation release.

### Parallel Provider CI

For relevant provider changes, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs three independent
jobs on dedicated macOS runners:

| Job | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Provider Unit Tests | Full provider test products, serial general suite, fresh-process isolated gates, MiMo metadata and synthetic fixtures plus all three native selections, packaged-resource/authentication/installer checks |
| Provider SDK Tests | Full nested SDK test products, DiffusionGemma, paged safety/hash/eligibility/backend/kernel/KV-sharing gates, and every required Nemotron/onboarding selector |
| Provider Prompt Parity | Real pinned tokenizer/template vectors, Swift/Go/Rust comparison, cold-load singleflight, and the release sidecar's sustained load proof |

The existing `Provider Tests` check aggregates all three results under the
[component-routing contract](#component-ci-routing). Every selected lane must
succeed. This keeps existing required-check coverage intact without an
out-of-band branch-protection change; after detection, the three selected macOS
lanes still start independently and run concurrently.

No numerical matrix, exclusive allocator assertion, or internal controlled
concurrency is removed. Tests sharing MLX globals remain serial within a process.
The jobs parallelize across machines rather than competing for one GPU. SDK gates
run after earlier assertion failures when their build and Metal setup succeeded;
missing prerequisites fail the lane instead of silently passing a skipped gate.
Public MiMo metadata is prepared with the existing checksum-pinned helper before
provider/parity execution. Native payload fixtures remain a separate prerequisite;
missing native inputs are not converted into skips or counted as speedups.

Run `python3 scripts/test-provider-ci-workflow.py`,
`python3 scripts/test-provider-ci-cache.py`, and
`python3 scripts/test-native-gpu-ci.py` for offline checks of job independence,
exact gate membership, failure propagation, compatible caching, and exclusivity.
Use the existing local `make provider-test` command for the full provider suite;
do not run two Swift builds against one `.build` directory concurrently.

`scripts/run-exclusive-native-gpu-test.sh` accepts only the reviewed allocator
and batch-composition test functions. It sets
`DARKBLOOM_EXCLUSIVE_NATIVE_GPU_TEST=1` for that one child process and passes
`--no-parallel`. Ordinary invocations explicitly remove inherited opt-in state.
`scripts/run-paged-kernel-tests.sh` runs the remaining kernel suite and then
the composition assertion separately, preserving both results if either fails.
Run these helpers only on an owned GPU test lane with the matched metallib;
they do not download model weights or manage an inference endpoint.

To check this CI wiring without invoking Swift or using a GPU, run
`python3 scripts/test-native-gpu-ci.py`. Its temporary fake `swift` executable
checks selector/opt-in isolation and verifies that failed assertions, actual
skips and zero executed tests still fail the existing tripwires. The same
CPU-only check runs in the Release Integrity job; it is not GPU qualification.

```bash
make provider-test
# = python3 scripts/test-stage-test-metallib.py
#   cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests
#   ./scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh <bin-path>   (build mlx.metallib from libs/mlx-swift source; copy it into every <bin-path>/*.xctest bundle)
#   cd provider-swift && ../scripts/run-provider-tests.sh
```

`PagedKernelPreflightTests.noisyChildCannotDeadlock` runs an owned failing child
with more stderr than a pipe buffer. It checks the bounded result ends with the
child's unique final diagnostic and excludes its initial marker, so keeping the
first bytes cannot pass as a valid tail. The same suite covers child failure,
fast-exit diagnostics, timeout and model-specific native smoke shapes. Run it
with the staged test product described here.

The metallib staging is not optional: MLX loads `mlx.metallib` from beside the
running executable, and for tests the executable is the `.xctest` runner.
Without it kernel-backed tests fail or silently exercise a different kernel
set than production. To run a subset: `cd provider-swift && swift test
--skip-build --filter <Suite>` after `make provider-test` has staged the
metallib once.

#### Provider coverage (report-only)

The Provider Unit Tests job builds the provider tests with `swift build
--build-tests --enable-code-coverage` (the `provider` lane of
`.github/actions/provider-ci-build`). The next step sets
`PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR` and `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` for the rest of the job, so
each provider test process writes its own `%p-%m.profraw` profile to one
directory. This includes the isolated native MiMo gates.
`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` sets the same `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` when
`PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR` is set, which is what the local recipe below uses.
The `swift test` calls do not pass `--enable-code-coverage`: with that flag,
SwiftPM deletes the profiles of earlier calls and replaces `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`.

The last steps of the Provider Unit Tests job merge the profiles with
`xcrun llvm-profdata merge`, run `xcrun llvm-cov` on the test bundle and the
four executables, and write a table to the job summary: lines, regions,
functions and an 80% target for each row. The table has four rows:

| Row | Targets |
|---|---|
| Product | `ProviderCore`, `ProviderCoreFoundation`, `ProviderAppAttest`, `DarkbloomFanCore`: the code that serves requests |
| CLI | `darkbloom` |
| Benchmark | `ProviderBenchmark` |
| Total | every file in the report, including the targets that have no row of their own |

The full report is kept for 14 days as the `provider-coverage` artifact:
`provider-coverage.txt` and `provider-coverage.json` have every file, and
`provider-coverage-summary.md` has the table. The denominator is the Swift code in
`provider-swift/Sources`. `Tests/`, `.build/` and the `libs/` checkouts do not
count. The Provider SDK Tests and Provider Prompt Parity lanes build without
coverage in their own jobs and do not count. The one C++ file in
`ProviderMetallibControl` is not instrumented. Swift has no branch counters.
A low number does not fail the job. The report step fails only when there are
no profiles, a value is missing or a row has no lines; the test steps keep
their own results.

To measure the local provider suite, first initialize the pinned submodules and
use the [provider build prerequisites](build.md#prerequisites). Run on an owned
Apple Silicon test machine, with no other build using this `.build` directory.
The runner isolates `DARKBLOOM_STATE_FILE` and `DARKBLOOM_LOADED_MODELS_FILE` in a
fresh temporary directory and removes that state on exit. The profile directory
below is also fresh, but retained for inspection; it never merges a previous
build's counters. Leave unrelated live-model opt-ins unset.

```bash
(
set -e
cd provider-swift
swift build --build-tests --enable-code-coverage
swift build --product darkbloom-fan-helper --enable-code-coverage
bin=$(swift build --show-bin-path)
../scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh "$bin"
PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/darkbloom-coverage.XXXXXX")
export PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR
export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/%p-%m.profraw"
python3 ../scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py \
  --output "$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/mimo-fixtures"
export MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES="$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/mimo-fixtures"
export MIMO_V26_WIRED_METADATA_FIXTURE="$MIMO_V26_SERIAL_LOAD_FIXTURES/tiny-bf16"
python3 ../scripts/prepare-mimo-prompt-fixtures.py \
  --output "$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/mimo-prompt-fixtures"
export MIMO_PROMPT_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY="$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/mimo-prompt-fixtures"
export MIMO_PROMPT_REFERENCE_VECTORS="$PWD/../fixtures/prompt-contract/mimo-v26-additional20.json"
export MIMO_V26_PROVIDER_LIFETIME_METADATA_TESTS=1
test_status=0
../scripts/run-provider-tests.sh || test_status=$?
xcrun llvm-profdata merge -sparse -o "$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/provider.profdata" \
  "$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR"/*.profraw
test_objects=()
for bundle in "$bin"/*.xctest; do
  test -d "$bundle" || continue
  test_objects+=(-object "$bundle/Contents/MacOS/$(basename "$bundle" .xctest)")
done
test "${#test_objects[@]}" -gt 0
xcrun llvm-cov report "$bin/darkbloom" "${test_objects[@]}" \
  -object "$bin/darkbloom-fan-helper" \
  -object "$bin/darkbloom-enclave" -object "$bin/darkbloom-publish" \
  -instr-profile "$PROVIDER_COVERAGE_DIR/provider.profdata" \
  -ignore-filename-regex '/(Tests|\.build|libs)/' "$PWD/Sources"
exit "$test_status"
)
```

This preserves a failing test exit even when reporting succeeds. It prepares
the bounded synthetic MiMo inputs required by scanner and load-quotation tests
and fetches four checksum-pinned public prompt metadata files, never model weights
or credentials. It does not fetch the audio [MiMo CI fixtures](#mimo-provider-ci-fixtures)
or enable selected native gates, so its totals need not match CI. Keep instrumentation
enabled when building every reported product; do not use these instrumented
timings as production throughput evidence.

For a custom SwiftPM `--scratch-path`, stage the authoritative `mlx.metallib`
in the active `debug` or `release` directory containing the `.xctest` bundle.
`LiveInferenceFixtures.findSourceMetallib` uses that same-configuration source
before replacing the runner copy; a runner-local file alone is insufficient.

Live-fixture result collection must retain both ordinary errors and typed
terminal failures. The loop-path arms in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/EngineV2PagedParityLiveTests.swift`
reuse `collect` and require completion usage as well as output.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Gemma/GemmaToolCallLiveTests.swift`
uses `LiveInferenceFixtures.swift`'s shared `collect` result before parsing a
tool call. The video mixed-media and standalone response fixtures use throwing
requirements before accessing a required image span or response choice. Run
each enabled live suite in its own supervised process; disabled model gates
provide no inference evidence.

`LiveInferenceFixtures.buildProduct` likewise anchors updater child executables,
fan helpers and resource bundles to the running test bundle's configuration.
Release tests do not require or borrow a separate `.build/debug` tree. Missing
active-configuration products remain failures; no peer-configuration fallback is
used. This is test-fixture discovery, not release signing or deployment evidence.

Tests that change process-wide MLX settings must use Swift Testing's
`#expect(processExitsWith: .success)` child-process boundary. Restoring an
environment variable does not reset MLX's cached value, and `.serialized`
does not isolate other suites. See `StartCommandTests.defaultApplyProjectsSettings`
in `provider-swift/Tests/DarkbloomCLITests/StartCommandTests.swift` and
`GPUEnforcementTests.requireMetalPinsGPU` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/GPUEnforcementTests.swift`.

The standalone resource-release test and the two periodic MTP sampler tests
also use child processes, giving their real listener/timer tasks an executor
separate from concurrent MLX tests. Their original deadlines, recurring-sample
requirements and shutdown/resource assertions remain active. Each helper
requires `ExitTest.current` so it cannot accidentally run in the parent process.
See `standaloneServerStopAndWaitReleaseResidentBridgeAndSSDResources` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Server/StandaloneServerTests.swift` and
`periodicSamplerEmitsForEverySlot` / `shutdownStopsSampler` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Telemetry/MTPPostureTelemetryTests.swift`.

#### Stream and model-list assertions

After building and staging the test product above, run:

```bash
cd provider-swift
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel \
  --filter 'batcherDeliversEveryFrameExactlyOnce|multiModelEngineReturnsSortedIDs|tokenizeFailure'
```

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Coordinator/ChunkSenderTests.swift`
(`batcherDeliversEveryFrameExactlyOnce`) requires the complete sequence of unique
eight-byte frames after the existing delivery deadline and flush barrier.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngineTests.swift`
(`multiModelEngineReturnsSortedIDs`) checks nonempty registry and advertised
model lists; the advertised input is deliberately out of order.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Engine/EngineV2BridgeTests.swift`
(`tokenizeFailure`) requires an error event before checking its message.
These use the real batcher and adapter with scripted dependencies, not model inference.

**Nested `libs/mlx-swift-lm` suites.** The paged-KV correctness gates live in
the submodule, not in `provider-swift/`. Build them once, stage the metallib,
then run each suite through [`scripts/run-nested-suite.sh`](../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh),
which fails when a suite executes zero tests or skips any (a bare
`swift test --filter` exits 0 on an empty run):

```bash
cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
swift package unedit --force mlx-swift >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
swift package edit --path ../mlx-swift mlx-swift      # use the local mlx-swift, not the remote branch
swift build --build-tests
../../scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh "$(swift build --show-bin-path)"   # stage mlx.metallib into every nested test bundle
for suite in CBv2PagedSafetyTests CBv2PrefixCacheHasherTests CBv2PagedEligibilityTests \
             CBv2PagedBackendTests CBv2PagedKernelTests CBv2KVSharingParityTests; do
  ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
done
```

#### Finding provider tests

Start from the production owner, then look in the matching folder under
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/`. These folders remain one SwiftPM
target (`provider-swift/Package.swift`, `package`), so existing suite/function
filters still select the same tests. The [inference source map](../architecture/inference.md#code-map)
locates those owners under `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/`;
tests group engine, bridge, factory and scheduler responsibilities together in
`Inference/Engine`.

| Folder below `ProviderCoreTests` | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Inference/Engine` | Assembly, admission, cancellation, health, device gates and timing |
| `Inference/Memory` | Load budgets, KV grants, allocation ownership and memory telemetry |
| `Inference/PrefixCache` | Reuse eligibility, cache identity, receipts and routing evidence |
| `KVCacheSSD` | Encrypted SSD storage, checkpoint coordination and persistence |
| `Inference/MTP` | Assistant activation and inference capacity accounting |
| `Inference/Prompting`, `Inference/Tools`, `Inference/Streaming`, `Inference/Vision` | Request preparation, tool contracts, streamed output and media handling |
| `Inference/Kernels` | Synthetic Metal arithmetic and accuracy contracts |
| `Inference/Live` | Opt-in inference and parity tests using actual local models, with `Gemma`, `GPTOSS` and `Qwen` subfolders |

Other folders follow provider responsibilities: `ProviderLoop`, `Server`,
`Models`, `SpecDec`, `Auth`, `Security`, `Diagnostics`, `Protocol`, `Coordinator`,
`Telemetry`, `Update`, and the smaller source subsystems. `Benchmark` tests
the `ProviderBenchmark` module and its production-engine integration.
Drain/swap orchestration stays with `ProviderLoop` and `Server`.

#### Provider lifecycle, CLI and benchmark groups

These groups run in the ordinary provider test products. Paths in the first
column are below `provider-swift/Tests/`; suite names are usable with
`swift test --skip-build --no-parallel --filter` after building and staging the
matched metallib. Prefer `scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` for the complete run
and its state isolation and fresh-process gates.

| Test group | Representative suites and assertions | Fixture boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `ProviderCoreTests/ProviderLoop` | `ModelLoadRefusalTests`, `ModelLoadEvictionAndAdmissionTests`, `ModelSlotBookkeepingTests`: admission, eviction, slot publication, rollback and saved loaded-model state | Temporary model/state files, scripted engines and memory inputs |
| `ProviderCoreTests/Server` | `StandaloneServerModelAdmissionTests`, `StandaloneServerDrainTests`: load limits, same-model reuse, active-request drain and shutdown | Scripted engines; local request and ownership paths, not model-quality evidence |
| `ProviderCoreTests/ProviderLoop` and `ProviderCoreTests/Server` | `TinyModelLoadTests`: real loader, hash/tokenizer/sizing, generation, reuse and unload through provider and standalone owners | Generated tiny GPT-OSS checkpoint; actual MLX execution |
| `ProviderCoreTests/ProviderLoop` and `ProviderCoreTests/Update` | `ServeLoopConnectionTests`, `ServeLoopDispatchTests`, `AutoUpdateCycleTests`: registration, reconnect, encrypted dispatch/cancellation and update recovery | Loopback coordinator, software signing key, scripted engine, temporary install root and injected restart/host services |
| `ProviderCoreTests/Service` and `ProviderCoreTests/KVCacheSSD` | `LaunchAgentLifecycleTests`, `SSDPrefixCacheFactoryPathTests`, `SSDPrefixCacheFactoryRefusalTests`, `SSDPrefixCacheFactoryConstructionTests`, `SSDPrefixCacheFactoryMaintenanceTests`: service lifecycle, cache construction/refusals, epochs and maintenance | Scripted launchctl, temporary home/cache roots and ephemeral cache keys |
| `DarkbloomCLITests` | Command-run, doctor, picker, start/service/watchdog and fan suites: parsing, output, refusals, persistence and cleanup | Child-process command sandbox, stubbed HTTP, scripted terminal input and injected service/SMC operations |
| `ProviderCoreTests/Benchmark` | `ArrivalInvarianceMeasurementTests`, `BackendParityHarnessProbeTests`, `SchedulerPrefillDecisionLiveRunnerTests`, `ThroughputSweepNotesTests`, `ModelBenchmarkReportTests`, `BenchmarkEntryPointRefusalTests`: event accounting, cancellation, metadata, reporting and entry-point refusals | Scripted benchmark engines and temporary reports; no performance or model-parity qualification |

`Inference/Fixtures/TinyModelCheckpoint.swift` (`TinyModelCheckpoint`) creates
seeded synthetic weights and tokenizer files in a temporary Hugging Face cache
layout. It needs Apple Silicon, a working Metal runtime and the source-matched
metallib, but no downloaded checkpoint. Its load-admission inputs are scripted;
post-load headroom checks still read the actual machine. Run with `--no-parallel`:
the shared `TinyModelLoadTests` suite is serialized, but that alone does not
isolate the process-wide model-cache setting from other suites. Generated-token
and cleanup assertions prove this tiny execution path, not trained-model output
quality, full-checkpoint memory bounds or production throughput.

`DarkbloomCLITests/CLICommandSandbox.swift` (`CLICommandSandbox.enter`) changes
environment and shared URL-session behavior only inside exit-test children.
Keep command config, auth tokens, caches, daemon/guard/watchdog state and test
reports temporary. Service/fan tests must use their injected host and SMC
boundaries: they do not authorize real `sudo`, launchd installation, fan writes,
Keychain changes or provider restarts. The SSD factory tests use in-memory keys;
persistent-Keychain qualification remains a separate opt-in procedure. Never
replace fixture URLs or tokens with production endpoints or credentials.

`Benchmark/ScriptedBenchmarkEngine.swift` (`ScriptedBenchmarkEngine`) supplies
controlled events and counters to the real measurement code. A passing harness
test is not a measured speedup or proof of backend numerical parity. Use the
separate model-backed gates for those claims. Coverage reports count executed
code, not these evidence distinctions; retain test results and prerequisites
alongside the report.

#### Watchdog launch-adapter regression

After [building the test product](build.md#5-provider-cli-swift-with-source-matched-metallib),
run this CPU-only selection from `provider-swift`:

```bash
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel --jobs 2 --force-resolved-versions \
  --filter 'WatchdogLaunchAdapterTests|LaunchAgentLifecycleTests|refusedKickstartRollsBackTrip|rollbackRestoresPreexistingGuard'
```

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Service/LaunchAgentLifecycleTests.swift`
exercises the actual `WatchdogRecoveryService`, `LaunchAgent.kickstartIfLoaded`
and disk-backed crash-loop guard with a temporary install and scripted
`LaunchctlControl`. Missing-service responses after a successful loaded check
must return `noLongerLoaded`, restore the exact prior guard bytes and invoke no
trip callback. Controls cover an already absent job, successful kickstart and
permission errors; the lifecycle suite preserves manual restart reload and
stop/uninstall behavior. No real launchctl, model, GPU or coordinator is used.
This selection does not establish native race frequency or fleet telemetry
delivery. Retain the Swift Testing case results and source revisions; the
preceding XCTest summary can report zero tests.

#### Shared fixture locations

Keep model fixtures in `Inference/Live/Fixtures`, synthetic engine support in
`Inference/Fixtures`, checkpoint support in `KVCacheSSD/Fixtures`, and shared
HTTP/coordinator fixtures in `Helpers`. Shared input files under `fixtures/`
and `coordinator/tests/protocol/testdata/` remain canonical; moving a test deeper
requires checking any lookup based on `#filePath`.
`CachePromptParityTests.vectorFile` locates the owning repository using its
provider and coordinator manifests instead of assuming a fixed source-folder
depth. Its three suites still read the canonical shared vectors; a missing
fixture fails the test and is never replaced by a skip or copied test data.

Check each suite's annotations and prerequisites before running it. Tests
that need no model weights can still execute Metal. The startup decode live
test stays with its `ProviderLoop` owner, and `LiveInferenceMetallibSourceTests`
tests the fixture resolver without loading a model. Use the preparation and
isolated filters above; folder names do not change execution requirements.

#### Doctor capture and attestation canonical bytes

After building the provider test targets, run these focused regressions:

```bash
(cd provider-swift && swift test --filter 'DoctorCaptureTests|statusCanonical')
(cd coordinator && go test -race ./tests/attestation -count=1)
```

`provider-swift/Tests/DarkbloomCLITests/DoctorCaptureTests.swift`
(`DoctorCaptureTests`) uses real subprocesses with output beyond pipe capacity,
excluded stderr, nonzero exits, deadline escalation and an inherited stdout
descriptor. Each child has an independent expiry and fixture-owned cleanup.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Security/StatusCanonicalTests.swift`
(`statusCanonicalMatchesCoordinatorNestedMapVectors`) and
`coordinator/tests/attestation/status_canonical_mixed_case_test.go`
(`TestBuildStatusCanonicalNestedMapVectors`) retain identical
golden bytes for nested-map ordering, escaping and optional fields. These cases
need no model weights, active provider or Secure Enclave key.

#### Strict FP32 unit controls

Run the strict tiny-model projection and scheduled-prefill comparisons in fresh
processes with TF32 disabled, matching MLX's own unit-test runner:

```bash
cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
for suite in GPTOSSPrefillOutputTests CBv2Gemma4ScheduledPrefillTests; do
  MLX_ENABLE_TF32=0 ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite" -c release --no-parallel
done
```

Build and stage the optimized test product and its matching metallib first.
`libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/python/tests/run.py` disables TF32 for regular
FP32 test precision. `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/utils.h`
(`env::enable_tf32`) otherwise defaults it on and caches the value per process;
Metal matmul and attention consult that gate. On M5, the default TF32 paths can
change these strict unit comparisons without a cache implementation change.
Keep the original assertions and tolerances. This command qualifies only the
selected controls, not the full test suite. Leave `MLX_ENABLE_TF32` unset for
production-default live cache tests and model benchmarks; record any explicit
numerical override as a separate experiment.

#### Ordinary teacher-forced score diagnostics

Build and stage the source-matched metallib for both test products as above.
From the repository root, run the numerical/engine controls and the provider
input/CLI controls; the shared runner rejects empty or skipped suites:

```bash
(
  cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
  for suite in CBv2TeacherForcedScoreDiagnosticTests CBv2TeacherForcedScoringTests \
               CBv2TeacherForcedRecurrentTests CBv2TeacherForcedCapacityTests \
               CBv2PagedRuntimeDTypeEngineTests \
               CBv2TopTwoTests CBv2LogitDiagnosticTests CBv2GemmaLogitDiagnosticTests; do
    ../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
  done
)
(
  cd provider-swift
  for suite in TeacherForcedBenchmarkTests BenchmarkTeacherForcedOptionsTests \
               BenchmarkSchedulerPrefillDecisionTests PrefixCacheCheckpointIdentityTests; do
    ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh "$suite"
  done
)
```

For an actual model observation, retain exact prompt and continuation token IDs
and the verified model aggregate hash in the [input JSON schema](../provider/cli-reference.md#teacher-forced-scores).
Set `MODEL_ID`, `INPUT_JSON` and `REPORT_JSON` to the matching local model and
absolute input/output paths, then run:

```bash
darkbloom benchmark --model "$MODEL_ID" --kv-backend contiguous \
  --teacher-forced-input "$INPUT_JSON" > "$REPORT_JSON"
```

Use `paged` to observe that backend explicitly. Inspect `status`,
`inconclusiveReasons`, `plainTop1`, `activity`, `diagnostic` and
`repeatedDiagnostic`; retain the JSON even on exit 2. `observed` means the
instrumentation controls passed, not that model quality or speculative
verification passed. The controls compare ordinary forwards only
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/TeacherForcedBenchmark.swift`,
`controlReasons`).

Recurrent targets use fresh request-owned state for each scoring call. The
scorer reserves the normal admission peak before forwarding, commits evaluated
state after each chunk or forced token, and retires state and KV before refunding
the reservation. The [recurrent scoring validation](../reports/2026-09-06-recurrent-teacher-scoring.md)
covers tight capacity and open-binding failure recovery on both backends.

#### Quantized bias accumulation regression

`QuantizedBiasAccumulatorTests` covers 216 exact affine-bias cases across
BF16, FP16 and FP32 inputs, quantization widths 2/3/4/5/6/8, aligned and tail
dimensions, and one/two input rows. Zero packed weights and unit bias isolate
input accumulation from weight quantization. Run it after the
[embedded shader rebuild](build.md#swift-provider-macos):

```bash
cd provider-swift
../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh QuantizedBiasAccumulatorTests
```

The provider test target links the canonical test from `libs/mlx-swift`.
The test scopes GPU selection with public `MLX.Device.withDefaultDevice`, so
both targets compile the same test without depending on target-local helpers.
Passing these operator cases does not replace full-model trajectory, cache,
batching or performance validation.

#### Sampled MTP acceptance controls

Build the [candidate radix executable](build.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-executable)
with `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1`. Both `scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py`
and `radix-engine` accept `--mtp-acceptance exact|typical`. The wrapper forwards
the option only when explicitly supplied, preserving old baseline command lines;
omission leaves the candidate on `exact`. Historical baseline builds reject the
explicit flag. Values are the exact lowercase strings, not `typical:<delta>`.
This flag selects acceptance, not MTP activation: pass `--mtp on` separately.

For an eligible target-prefix model, compare `exact` and `typical` using the same
candidate binary, target/assistant hashes, backend, grant, prompt, seed, sampling
knobs and output budget. Use sampled inputs and
`--generation-comparison-policy record`, retaining full outputs and structural,
capacity, cancellation and retirement checks. Typical output is not
distribution-exact; token differences are not a greedy parity failure, and a
higher acceptance ratio alone proves neither quality nor throughput. Keep strict
greedy controls separate. Native MiMo does not apply this preference and remains
exact; do not report it as a typical-acceptance arm.

The candidate SSD route passes `mtpAcceptanceConfig: String = "exact"` through
`EngineV2Factory.makeBenchmarkSession` (`@_spi(Benchmarking)`) to the ordinary
slot factory. The resident route sets the same engine rule directly. Actual MTP
metrics report `acceptance`, the installed rule, rather than merely the requested
flag (`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Sources/radix-engine/BenchmarkMetrics.swift`,
`mtpRecord`). Production serving still uses TOML; the separate benchmark-session
environment override is documented in the
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#engine-and-scheduler).

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p test_run_radix_engine.py`
for wrapper omission/forwarding and invalid-value coverage. With the same source
root and candidate define used for the build, run the radix package's
`BenchmarkMTPAcceptanceTests` for default/configuration, invalid/duplicate flags,
and installed configuration/metric serialization. Also run provider
`MTPAcceptanceConfigTests` for optional TOML round trips, per-model precedence,
unknown-value fallback and the separate benchmark override. These tests are not
real-model quality or performance measurements.

<a id="resident-prefix-benchmark-validation"></a>

#### Explicit Gemma verifier and projection controls

Use the candidate `radix-engine` built from the same provider, native source and
metallib tuple as the test runners.
Candidate inputs use `EngineV2Factory.benchmarkPrompt` and the serving sampling
translator, including the raw-body seed, logit-bias and logprobs overlays.
Every completed or cancelled row reports its effective `sampling`; batched copies
preserve those knobs. Omitted sampling stays greedy. The production API currently
sets `min_p` to zero, including when an unrecognized `min_p` request key is present.
Native direct `Input` fixtures can still exercise engine `minP` independently.

Use `--generation-comparison-policy record` for sampled throughput probes: a seed also
depends on request ID and step index, so separate donor/recovery requests are not
an exact-token oracle. Do not change the strict default for greedy controls.
Nonempty stop strings and `response_format` require HTTP testing and are rejected.
Forced tool choices are rejected for sampled inputs; retained greedy tool-template
probes measure rendering and raw engine events, without HTTP constraint enforcement.
Explicit Gemma verification, projection, logits and attention diagnostics require
untransformed greedy input. Historical baseline binaries retain their greedy
sampling path; they are not sampled-throughput controls.
Sampling wiring lives in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkPrompt.swift`
and `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Sources/radix-engine/BenchmarkSampling.swift`.

Run the CPU wrapper tests first:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p test_run_radix_engine.py
```

After building each package's tests and staging that tuple's metallib as above,
run these filters through `scripts/run-nested-suite.sh` from the listed package:

| Package | Filters |
|---|---|
| `provider-swift` | `EngineV2BenchmarkMTPVerificationTests`, `BenchmarkProductionInputTests` |
| `libs/mlx-swift-lm` | `Gemma4Layer0ProjectionDiagnosticTests` |
| `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine` | `BenchmarkGemmaVerifierOptionsTests`, `BenchmarkGemmaProjectionTests`, `BenchmarkSamplingTests` |

For the radix package, set `RADIX_SOURCE_ROOT` to the absolute combined checkout
and `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` for both build and test commands. The tests cover
scope refusals, unchanged MTP configuration fields, actual tiny-engine rounds
and retirement, native projection shapes/parameter identity, and full-output
difference counts. They do not validate a downloaded model.

For a real-model control, append `--gemma-mtp-verification automatic` or
`--gemma-mtp-verification serial_target` to `scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py`.
Both require `--mtp on --cache off --concurrency 1 --cache-mode ssd
--production-kv-grant`, a pinned `--expected-model-sha256`, an explicit
`--kv-backend contiguous|paged`, and a compatible loaded Gemma assistant.
Omitting the flag leaves normal verifier selection unchanged. Run fresh
ordinary MTP-off, automatic and serial processes for each backend using the
same reviewed artifact, input bytes, assistant, prompt date and output limit.
Keep all seven completed trajectories and cancellation recovery evidence.

Inspect `gemma_mtp_verification_requested` together with the actual `mtp`
metrics: the selected strategy must have positive rounds and the other strategy
must have zero rounds. Compare complete prompt/output IDs and finish reasons
separately for each pair. Serial agreement cannot pass the automatic gate.

To inspect layer zero, add `--gemma-projection-tokens SEED,SECOND_TOKEN` to one
explicit-verifier invocation, without other numerical diagnostic flags. Preserve
the record or stated inference that selected the second token. The adjacent
`.gemma-projection/projection.json` and native `.bin` files retain actual
embedding, inputLayernorm and Q/K/V outputs for M1/M2, tensor dtypes/strides,
loaded parameter hashes and complete first-column differences. Check embedding
and normalized-input identity before attributing a projection difference.
Internal kernel identity is unmeasured; this process's timing is diagnostic
overhead. Neither capture nor a passing tiny-model test establishes model-token
correctness. Controls: `EngineV2BenchmarkMTPVerification.validateScope` and
`validateObservedMetrics`; export: `BenchmarkGemmaProjection.capture` in
`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Sources/radix-engine/BenchmarkGemmaProjection.swift`.

#### Offline attention packet analysis

Create the [isolated NumPy environment](build.md#offline-attention-analysis-environment),
then run from the repository root:

```bash
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -B -W error -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p 'test_attention_packet*.py'
PYTHONPATH=scripts/benchmarks /tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -B -m attention_packet /absolute/packet.json --output /absolute/new-analysis.json
```

The output path must be new. Review the reported status, original-query reference,
nonfinite counts and last-row consistency. `analyzed` means the calculation ran;
it does not establish model correctness or pass a release gate. Unsupported or
unconfirmed captures remain inconclusive. The [packet format](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md)
defines required native bytes and metadata; [synthetic calibration](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-packet-analyzer.md)
records what the tests prove.

#### Attention operator replay

The [standalone tool](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay/README.md) validates
a confirmed packet v1, then runs native SDPA and fixed/segmented paged decode
sequentially on identical Q/K/V bytes. From `scripts/benchmarks`, use the dedicated
NumPy environment:

```bash
python -B -m unittest -v test_attention_replay test_attention_packet test_attention_packet_numerics
python -B -m attention_replay --packet /owned/capture/packet.json \
  --output /owned/new-replay --prepare-only
python -B -m attention_replay --packet /owned/capture/packet.json \
  --output /owned/another-new-replay --binary /reviewed/attention-replay \
  --binary-sha256 EXACT_SHA256
```

Use a new output directory each time. The Swift CLI checks the input-transfer
hash and raw tensor hashes before MLX allocation. For captured-output reproduction,
use the capture host and reviewed runtime resources; a different device is a
separately labeled numerical experiment.

The native SPI seeds only T−1 tokens with the existing writer, then performs the
real incoming-token write through `updateAndAttend`. Full readback bytes are
checked after evaluation. Paged dispatch is observed through the existing hook;
the synthetic selection is never marked as a confirmed model sample. Native SDPA
identifies the API invoked, not an instrumented internal MLX kernel variant.

`ReplayHostTests` covers bounded transfer/IO/options. `ReplayOperatorTests` executes
24 synthetic operator cases plus one host guard, with all three genuine arms in
each operator case. The existing native reference ceiling `1e-2` and paged bound
`max(3 * contiguous relativeL2, 1e-2)` remain unchanged. Exact storage bytes and
fixed/segmented output identity are separate checks. The [milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-operator-replay.md)
retains exact source and test provenance.

Original Q drives the independent CPU FP32 reference; a narrowed-Q counterfactual
is separate. Storage mismatch, nonfinite output or failure to reproduce the
originally captured backend output makes interpretation inconclusive. Failed arms
stop and retain their process receipt even if log hashing fails. No model-token
or numerical release gate is evaluated. Supplied-history placement does not prove
original model-history correctness; the full-history mirror and cross-backend
Q/K/V identity remain separate investigations.

#### Segmented metadata profiler

Use the [isolated optimized build](build.md#segmented-metadata-profiler) on an idle
Apple Silicon host, with matching runtime resources beside the binary:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/BenchSegmentedDecode --owners 10 --offset 5584 --warmup 8 --steps 64 --repetitions 3 > /absolute/new-measurement.json
```

The tool compares cached and freshly rebuilt metadata on identical synthetic
inputs and refuses differing output or full-history hashes. Inspect per-owner
hit/rebuild counts, resolved geometry and separate host/fenced timings. These
measure attention work; use the real-model benchmark for end-to-end performance.
The [measurement record](../reports/2026-09-06-segment-metadata-profiler.md) retains
the source, boundary tests and observed timing scope.

#### Prefix-cache benchmark validation

The standalone scripts under [`scripts/benchmarks`](../../scripts/benchmarks/radix_prefix_cache.py)
retain complete requests, SSE events, token counts, cache evidence, and GPU
telemetry. Use a dedicated idle Mac with the model already downloaded. The
runner refuses concurrent ranked work and owns only its child processes.

```bash
# Use the attention-analysis environment below for the NumPy-dependent tests.
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_http.py --binary /path/to/baseline/darkbloom \
  --output /path/to/new-baseline-run --mtp off --cache on
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_http.py --binary /path/to/candidate/darkbloom \
  --output /path/to/new-candidate-run --mtp off --cache on \
  --replay /path/to/new-baseline-run/http/report.json
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py --binary /path/to/radix-engine \
  --model-directory /path/to/pinned-model-snapshot \
  --input /path/to/new-baseline-run/http/report.json \
  --output /path/to/new-engine-run --cache on
python3 scripts/benchmarks/compare_radix_engine.py baseline-engine.json candidate-engine.json \
  --expect-cache-hits
```

Build each engine probe using the [pinned-worktree instructions](build.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-executable).
HTTP equality proves full text and token counts; the engine comparison checks
actual generated token IDs, clean termination, saved tokens, tenant separation,
and cancellation recovery. Compare MTP-on and MTP-off against their respective
baselines. A cache lookup with zero saved tokens does not demonstrate reuse.
The connected SSE reader treats `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` as aliases
for one delta: it appends one value and rejects conflicting non-null values.
Different chunk boundaries must not change reconstructed reasoning. The captured
real-stream replay runs under `go test ./e2e -run '^TestConnectedReasoning'`
(`e2e/connected_cache_reasoning_test.go`).
For schema-2 reports, the default cache axis requires cache off then cache on,
with the same requested store/key modes and resolved backend. Every disabled
probe must report zero saved tokens and no hit. Use `--axis backend` for a
contiguous-to-paged pair with identical cache settings. Legacy report support
does not establish the current release gates (`compare_radix_engine.py`, `compare`).
Both runners accept `--mtp on` and `--kv-backend paged`; their defaults are MTP
off and backend auto. The current direct candidate defaults to `--cache-mode ssd`.
For a separately reviewed generation-variation experiment, pass
`--generation-comparison-policy record` to `run_radix_engine.py` and a probe
built with that option. The default is `strict`. Record mode retains raw token
arrays and every same-prompt comparison, including row identities, token hashes,
equality outcomes and first differing positions. It continues past generated-token
differences while structural, authenticated restore, tenant isolation, cancellation
and cleanup checks remain required. A record-mode report never has
`strict_generation_pass: true`; review task quality separately. The standard
`compare_radix_engine.py` stays strict and rejects record-mode reports. A reviewed
diagnostic consumer must explicitly request `report_errors(report, "record")`
from `scripts/benchmarks/radix_engine_evidence.py` and retain the comparison
failures. Preserve prior strict failures as separate evidence.
The direct candidate uses the normal slot factory, production prompt/tool normalization, normal
MTP preparation and verified pre/post-load model identity. For an external
assistant, `--assistant-directory` supplies an exact flat artifact to the normal
offline verification funnel; it does not bypass target compatibility.
The directory must contain only `config.json` and its safetensors files; keep
the catalog/provenance manifest outside it. `SpecDecStore.inspectLocalArtifact`
rejects other entries, including `manifest.json`.
`--expected-model-sha256` pins the aggregate and `--prompt-date YYYY-MM-DD`
pins missing request-owned dates for paired runs. Raw media needs the HTTP path. It refuses requested MTP without an active driver,
a cache-on arm without a ready SSD store, and any resident-memory opt-in.
Start TTFT before `session.submit` so authenticated staging is included
(`EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkSession.swift`, `BenchmarkLoader.swift`).

For bounded concurrency, add `--concurrency 2` or `--concurrency 4` to the
engine runner. Each input is submitted as that many simultaneous requests;
reports retain every row, submission failure, batch duration, aggregate output
rate, and capacity/MLX-memory samples at 100 ms intervals. Compare with a cold
oracle from the same binary, concurrency, slot grant, model and MTP mode.
Choose the grant mode explicitly for the measurement. Use
`--production-kv-grant` for a single loaded model's full production grant, or
`--kv-budget-gib N` for an explicit envelope control. With neither flag the
historical explicit default remains 16 GiB. B1/B2/B4 changes request concurrency,
not the number of loaded model slots. Record the observed backend and capacity,
and reject a requested paged arm that falls back. The comparator rejects missing/failed batch rows and unobserved
concurrency in either arm. B4 identifies four submitted requests; the sampled
overlap check does not certify four simultaneously admitted sequences or a
continuous memory peak. It checks staged-memory release after the whole batch drains;
another active request may still own staging when an individual row ends.
These raw-engine batches exercise shared native admission for segmented storage;
they do not cover bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge reservations or HTTP framing.

Candidate builds with `RADIX_CANDIDATE` emit report schema 3 and bounded
`forward_shapes` telemetry. After warmup, the benchmark opens a fresh observation
scope and records before/after snapshots around each measured cohort. A new
scope requires the scheduler and in-flight work to drain, including discarded
chained successors whose output request has already stopped. B2/B4
acceptance requires a completed target decode or MTP-verification call with the
requested live row count in every cohort. Four B1 calls, speculative columns,
prefill rows and padded compiled components cannot satisfy that gate.

`submitted_calls` counts entry into model dispatch, including lazy graph
construction; it is not a GPU submission count. `completed_calls` records the
existing readback and MTP-finalization boundary. Counter retirement follows the
adaptive MTP cost sample. Snapshot/delta inconsistencies, pending or unconfirmed
work, unknown dispatches and dropped records reject the measured interval.
Component rows and sequence width remain separate axes. An observed full-width
call proves neither constant width for the whole request nor kernel launch
geometry; the existing concurrency, lifecycle and output gates still apply.
The native `CBv2ForwardShapeEngineTests` exercise packed/split target dispatch,
discarded chained work and refusal boundaries with storage-bearing cache rows
and actual KV progression. Run these alongside the scalar, compiled-expert and
MTP suites; scalar-only checks cannot establish serving behavior.
When the native engine exposes `paged_storage`, before/after metrics and batch
samples retain its queue-captured grant, committed backing, reserved/live pages,
poison, slack, and over-grant bytes, plus segment and address-page counts.
Committed bytes measure physical backing; they are not the logical token limit.

For a production-grant run, add the flag to the existing candidate invocation:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmarks/run_radix_engine.py --binary /path/to/final/radix-engine \
  --model-directory /path/to/exact-model \
  --input /path/to/pinned-http-report.json --output /path/to/new-run \
  --cache-mode ssd --key-mode persistent --cache on --kv-backend paged \
  --mtp on --concurrency 4 --production-kv-grant \
  --expected-model-sha256 "$MODEL_SHA256" --prompt-date 2026-09-05 --trial 1
```

Set `MODEL_SHA256` to the verified target aggregate. Keep the model's configured
MTP posture: use `--mtp off` for GPT-OSS; supply the verified
`--assistant-directory` for Gemma's normal assistant. Repeat with cache off,
contiguous storage and the other concurrency/trial values required by the plan,
using the same artifact and prompt date. The flag does not promote a different
artifact or silently disable MTP.

Verify `kv_grant_mode = "production_single_slot"` and the recorded
`production_grant`: hard/effective cap, operator reserve, cap fraction, loaded
target/assistant/total weights, activation reserve, zero RAM prefix allowance,
`slot_count = 1`, fleet budget and resulting grant. Require the actual engine
ceiling and shared process cap/reserve to agree with those inputs. The separate
`post_build_headroom_bytes` must pass the normal minimum serviceability gate;
a larger logical grant cannot waive insufficient live OS/activation headroom.
`post_load_maximum_kv_bytes` is the retained Memory.active diagnostic and an
explicit-mode guard only. Production mode uses loaded `SlotSizingSnapshot`
facts, not that allocator observation. See the
[grant mechanism](../architecture/hardware-support.md#kv-slot-grants).

Production mode is unavailable to resident reproduction, native-type-only probes
and callers injecting a multi-session budget. Co-resident tests must use the
real provider lifecycle or explicit grants with one shared process authority.
The comparator requires paired production-grant inputs to match and rejects
missing or inconsistent grant/headroom evidence (`radix_engine_evidence.py`,
`production_grant_errors`; `compare_radix_engine.py`, `compare`).

The candidate's `--native-kv-probe-only` mode requires cache-off, MTP-off and
concurrency one. Preserve its actual prefill/decode K/V observations before
selecting a paged native-type table. This target-only diagnostic does not prove
paged serving, MTP execution or prefix reuse; those require the normal benchmark
arms and their output oracle.

Record actual cache mode, key mode, stage time, saved tokens and idle reservation
counters. The session waits for pending refunds after a serial terminal. The
candidate harness then polls immutable snapshots at known serial, whole-batch
and shutdown boundaries until retirement is observable, with a five-second
monotonic deadline and cooperative yields. It does not advance engine steps or
change native gauges. Concurrent rows retain immediate observations; only their
completed batch has an idle boundary. Its
normal construction, shared native ownership and SSD staging are real; the
raw-engine measurement omits bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge reservations,
HTTP framing and coordinator routing.
Schema-2 SSD acceptance requires zero request activity, live KV and reserved/live
pages after serial rows and complete batches. The idle admission charge may
equal retained free physical backing. Shutdown additionally requires zero
segments, committed backing and process owners/closing owners/C/M/unmaterialized
promises. Logical `address_pages`, model-weight memory, allocator cache and RSS
need not be zero (`radix_engine_evidence.py`, `retirement_errors`).
Inspect `idle_observation`: `status` (`ready`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`),
`shutdown`, `attempts`, `elapsed_s`, `timeout_s`, and `pending_retirement`.
Timeout or cancellation preserves the last observed tuple and fails the result;
later successful cleanup does not replace an earlier failure. The deadline
bounds repeated polling, not an arbitrarily blocked snapshot implementation.
Request TTFT, decode, terminal-tail and batch elapsed timers stop before this
observation wait (`BenchmarkIdleObservation.swift`, `capture`). Archived reports
without coherent observations retain their original idle failures; terminal
delivery alone does not prove that gauges have published or that memory leaked.
Local provider HTTP measurements cover bridge admission and framing. Coordinator
routing has separate Go regression coverage; an end-to-end routing claim requires
a live multi-provider run. Record source and artifact hashes with every result;
[the cache architecture](../architecture/prefix-cache.md) links retained validation
evidence.

The connected routing fixture preserves the testbed's provider startup and process
logs, including provider-index attributes, alongside its structured routing
observations. A registration failure can occur before any routing decision;
inspect the captured test output as well as the report's routing rows
(`e2e/connected_cache_report_test.go`, `connectedRouteHandler`).

Schema 2 writes an atomic initial report before loading, then preserves every
completed, failed, aborted or not-run cell. Raw token IDs, chunks, usage and
errors survive a failure; later cells stop. Use distinct invocations with
`--trial 1`, `--trial 2`, and `--trial 3` for independent process repetitions.
Each invocation uses a fresh payload root unless `--cache-directory` explicitly
selects one for a restart test. Retain binary/model/input hashes, request date,
assistant identity, actual backend, key mode, slot grant and concurrency.

The comparator defaults to `--axis cache`, which requires the same backend.
Use `--axis backend` for contiguous versus paged with cache enabled state and
other settings held fixed. Missing, failed, unmatched or unexercised required
cells fail comparison; a clean fast completion is not cancellation evidence.
The current direct harness records `cancellation_probe_version = 2`. It first
completes a donor in the exact cancellation scope in both compared arms. For
paged SSD cache-on, cancellation must then show a real hit, staged import,
positive matched/saved tokens and a fresh authenticated read-byte increase.
The cancelled output must match a prefix of the donor output, and recovery
must reproduce the full donor output. Keep an eligible long-prompt control;
a short prompt below cache policy thresholds cannot establish this restore
case. The completed donor remains reusable after cancellation. Version 1
reports establish cold cancellation only and cannot be compared as version 2
(`RadixBenchmark.swift`, `BenchmarkGeneration.swift`,
`radix_engine_evidence.py`, `cancellation_errors`).

Decode rate excludes every token in the first nonempty delta and divides the
remaining tokens by elapsed time between the first and last deltas. This avoids
counting a first MTP chunk as later decode work; reports retain both raw counts.
Batch samples also retain process commitments, materialized backing, other
allocator use, retirement debt, allocator padding and write-host ownership.
Sampling observations are not a continuous peak guarantee.

Keep evidence scopes separate. `SegmentedProductionGrantTests` exercises native
page/ring/dtype and normal Qwen MTP accounting in synthetic 36/64/128 GiB
memory envelopes; zero-page construction and pure accounting are not measured
model capacity. `BenchmarkProductionGrantTests` checks policy composition and
the separate live minimum gate. A source freeze documents unrun code; a compiled
test result proves only its exercised fixtures. Neither replaces exact-model
B1/B2/B4 serving, real admission boundaries, latency/memory observations or
co-resident load/unload runs. The 0.9.0 candidate's `auto` policy prefers paged
for the [five exact release artifacts](../architecture/prefix-cache.md), subject
to capability checks and fallback. Verify the actual backend in each run;
the source default alone does not establish release acceptance.

The Python runner binds all three isolated-cache controls together: it sets
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL=1`, the owned
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_ROOT`, and
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_TEST_PERSISTENT_KEY=1` for persistent/default mode or
`0` for explicit ephemeral mode. These values override inherited test settings.
The root override is ignored without the affirmative isolation opt-in.

`--cache-mode ssd --key-mode persistent` is the SSD default and requires the
normal persistent KEK unless an explicit test namespace is selected;
`--key-mode ephemeral` is a non-restart test control.
Current SSD reports must prove the requested actual `metrics_loaded.key_mode`;
a missing or different mode fails the wrapper after preserving the report.
When invoking the executable directly, set the same environment controls as
well as the final `persistent-key` or `ephemeral-key` argument. That argument
controls acceptance and does not by itself select the key. Cache construction
refusal retains the exact pre-shutdown model status and evidence-source presence
in `EngineV2BenchmarkSession.Failure.ssdUnavailable`.

Assert persistent key mode, expected SSD mode and no resident bank for a restart
claim. Launch a fresh OS
process using the same binary/model,
identity settings, keys and payload root; an in-process `shutdown` is not a
restart or model-unload proof because the session/`Loaded` value can still own
`rawEngine`. Key bytes remain in the selected Secure Enclave/Keychain hierarchy,
never the payload root. Exact controls are in [the SSD reference](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#environment-variables).

<a id="isolated-persistent-test-namespace"></a>

For a standalone persistent test that keeps the default key selectors untouched,
provide both `--persistent-test-namespace UUID` and
`--persistent-test-access-group GROUP` alongside explicit `--cache-mode ssd
--key-mode persistent`. Use a fresh owned `--cache-directory` outside protected
cache roots and the concrete access group authorized for the signed benchmark.
For a later restart comparison, retain the same UUID, group, payload root,
binary/model/input identities and launch a new process into a new output directory.

The wrapper sets the three isolation environment controls above and forwards the
paired options unchanged except canonical UUID casing. Direct executable callers
must set the same context themselves. Partial/duplicate options, resident or
ephemeral mode, probe-only mode and unsafe roots refuse before model or key work.
The shared key loader repeats validation and forbids ephemeral fallback for a
namespace even when the isolation opt-in is enabled. Reports bind namespace,
enclave/wrapped-KEK selectors, root, group and observed key mode; cache-off rows can
truthfully report no created key. No key bytes are exported.

CPU wrapper coverage is `test_radix_persistent_test_keys.py`. Candidate Swift
coverage is `SSDPersistentTestKeyNamespaceTests` and
`BenchmarkPersistentTestKeysTests`; the former injects persistent-loader spies,
while the latter also verifies combination with packet/metadata/logit options.
Keep real Secure Enclave/Keychain tests separate from these source fixtures.
The [validated milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-persistent-ssd-test-namespace.md)
records 23 provider and 24 benchmark functions, with exact old/current source
provenance and preserved failures. This seam does not isolate full HTTP provider
attestation and is not evidence of an actual persistent restart.

Use `--cache-mode resident` only to reproduce earlier candidate artifacts.
That arm supplies a 1 GiB, 32-entry bank with two checkpoints per request, or
paged resident blocks on the explicit paged backend. Inspect `capacity_refusals`,
`retained_bytes`, `kv_compactions` and `kv_compaction_bytes` for long prompts.
Paged cancellation may leave finalized prefill blocks reusable; complete SSD
and hybrid-bank publication require natural donor termination. All arms require
exact recovery output. The comparator rejects observed cache-budget violations;
a latency-only plan reports no decode rate.
The historical [M5 baseline report](../reports/2026-09-05-radix-prefix-cache-baseline.md)
retains exact artifacts and measurement limits.
Use the [Gemma QAT4bit observation and paired-run evidence](../reports/2026-09-05-gemma-qat4-initial-pairs.md)
for that exact production artifact; keep it distinct from the earlier 8-bit Gemma
fixture. Native observer shapes describe incoming writes, not accumulated cache length.
The [initial supported backend groups](../reports/2026-09-05-supported-backend-groups.md)
retain passing GPT/Gemma8 comparisons, failing Qwen3.5 backend comparisons and
explicitly unrun historical contiguous-SSD cells. A passing cache pair alone
does not establish attention-backend parity.

To inspect a differing target decision, append both
`--logit-diagnostic-position <zero-based-output-index>` and
`--logit-diagnostic-candidates <id1,id2>` to the unchanged engine-wrapper command.
This requires B1 and explicit `--cache-mode ssd`; preserve the original backend,
MTP, cache-on/off setting, prompt and output budget. Capture observes the first
main request after warmup. Compare its emitted IDs and preceding context with
the corresponding uninstrumented control before interpreting the compact
`logit_diagnostic` records. Rejected speculative suffixes do not prove emitted
history, and missing confirmed records are inconclusive. Additional reductions
can perturb adaptive scheduling; do not use diagnostic runs as performance data.
Diagnostic top-two reduction is model-independent. It reuses a retained MTP
policy reduction when available and otherwise uses the common reducer; enabling
the diagnostic does not grant a model MTP policy eligibility. The
[generic reducer validation](../reports/2026-09-06-generic-logit-diagnostic-reducer.md)
covers the actual Gemma adapter. The [real-model QAT logit rerun](../reports/2026-09-06-gemma-qat-actual-logits.md)
passes four integrity cells and captures confirmed normal-MTP decisions while
retaining the strict backend token failure.
The [diagnostic source and validation record](../reports/2026-09-05-bounded-logit-diagnostic.md)
describes the bounded payload and unmeasured quantities.
The [Qwen3.6 actual-logit record](../reports/2026-09-05-qwen36-actual-logits.md)
retains same-build trace controls and the unresolved backend decision difference.
The [Gemma QAT MTP-off backend controls](../reports/2026-09-06-gemma-qat-mtp-off-controls.md)
pass exact comparison across all seven completed trajectories; the normal-MTP
failure remains a separate acceptance gate.


To observe actual attention input/cache dtypes, append
`--attention-metadata-position <zero-based-output-index>` to an ordinary B1,
MTP-off command with explicit `--cache-mode ssd`. Preserve cache-on/off, backend,
prompt and output budget. Index zero is unsupported because it is a prefill
decision. This flag can accompany the logit flags for the same position. Require
`attention_metadata.status=captured`, complete owner records and confirmed
seed/target identity before interpreting the result. Strides describe graph
construction; no tensor contents are captured. Use identical uninstrumented
controls and keep diagnostic timings out of performance summaries. The
[attention metadata validation record](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-metadata-diagnostic.md)
describes the bounds and lifecycle checks.

To capture native tensor bytes for one full-attention owner, append both
`--attention-packet-position <zero-based-output-index>` and
`--attention-packet-layer <dense-storage-index>` to the same ordinary B1,
MTP-off wrapper command with explicit `--cache-mode ssd`. Preserve backend,
cache-on/off, prompt and output budget. Position zero is unsupported. The dense
storage index is distinct from the original model layer index; verify both in
the captured owner metadata. Packet, metadata and logit selections are independent.

Require a captured, confirmed packet and unchanged completed trajectories against
a control from the same build before interpreting its bytes. The benchmark writes
the descriptor and six hashed native buffers beneath `report.attention-packet`;
use the [packet format](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md) and
[offline analysis procedure](#offline-attention-packet-analysis). Unsupported
geometry, incomplete history, a pending graph or an exceeded capture budget makes
the diagnostic inconclusive. Diagnostic timings are excluded from performance
comparisons. The [capture validation record](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-packet-capture.md)
documents native lifetime, byte-integrity and benchmark export coverage.

The [Qwen3.6 owner-0 packet record](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-owner0-packets.md)
retains four passing control/capture integrity cells, identical captured Q/K/V,
786 differing BF16 output elements and descriptive CPU reference comparisons.
The [same-input operator replay](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-owner0-operator-replay.md)
reproduces each captured output on its corresponding real operator, with exact
full KV readbacks in fixed and segmented paged pools. The strict whole-model
token comparison remains failed; this selected operator result is separate
from model-quality acceptance.
The [dispatch cache runtime comparison](../reports/2026-09-06-qwen36-dispatch-cache-comparison.md)
retains three matched pairs per MTP mode, exact complete trajectories and
chunk-aware delivered throughput, with mixed normal-MTP timing preserved.

For isolated Qwen3.6 attention geometry, run
`swift test --skip-build --filter 'CBv2PagedKernelTests/qwen36'` in the prepared
native package after building its tests. Require all 13 expanded cases and no
skips, then run `CBv2PagedKernelTests`, `CBv2PagedSegmentTests`, and
`CBv2PagedNativeDTypeTests` to cover the existing fixtures. Swift Testing filters
also match source filenames: the last filter includes two
`CBv2NativeKVTypeProbeTests` functions in the same file. Preserve actual suite and
case counts, numerical observations and failures. The [geometry validation record](../reports/2026-09-05-qwen36-attention-geometry.md)
distinguishes synthetic attention/storage coverage from real-model output parity.

For the corresponding unit tests, use the native nested-suite procedure above
with `CBv2PagedPrefixBlockCacheTests`, `CBv2PagedPrefixLeakTests`,
`CBv2PagedPoolGuardTests`, `CBv2FirstTokenWorkProjectionTests`,
`CBv2FirstTokenDeadlineEngineTests`, `CBv2TokenRadixIndexTests`,
`CBv2HybridPrefixCacheTests`, `CBv2RecurrentStateTests`,
`CBv2CompleteCheckpointTests`, and `CBv2CompleteCheckpointEngineTests`. Filters name the
declared test types, which can differ from filenames; the replay-plan class is
`CBv2FrozenReplayPlanTests`. MTP checkpoint checks also use
`Qwen35MTPDraftTrimTests` and `CBv2QwenMTPIntegrationTests`. Provider integration
filters include `EngineV2BridgeTests`, `EngineV2KVBackendGateTests`,
`PrefixCacheReceiptTests`, `SSDPrefixCache`, `ResidentPrefixCacheEvidenceTests`,
`SSDNativePrefixBuilderTests`, `SSDHybridCheckpointStoreTests`, and
`SSDCheckpointStageReservationTests`.
Use `EngineV2BridgePumpReceiptTests` for the real-engine submission/receipt
lifetime and cancellation regression; the [baseline failure and corrected-run evidence](../reports/2026-09-05-prefix-receipt-pump-ownership.md)
records its exact source and validation scope.

**Prompt parity** — `./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh` proves the three
prompt-contract implementations agree on the same production vectors; the
procedure, its inputs and the regeneration flow are in
[step 9](#9-prompt-contract-parity-fixtures-and-vectors).

**Installer** — `./scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` exercises the atomic
install/replace path of `scripts/install.sh` in a temp dir (and runs
`scripts/sync-install-embed.sh check` first).

### 5. Web UIs

```bash
make ui-test                     # cd console-ui && npm test  (vitest run)
make ui-lint                     # npx eslint src/
make ui-build                    # next build
cd admin-ui && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build
make landing                    # standalone install, lint, build and HTTP route tests
```

The path-filtered `.github/workflows/landing.yml` workflow runs `npm ci`,
lint, the production build (including TypeScript checks), and `npm test`.
The Node test suite in `landing/tests/routes.test.mjs` starts an isolated
production server to verify pages, legacy redirects, assets and unconfigured
API responses without production credentials or upstream requests. For a
migration or deployment, start it on port `3008` and check `/`, `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, the
`/docs` redirect, fonts/media, desktop and mobile scrolling, and chat states.
Verify `/api/network` and `/api/about` against the configured upstreams;
without a key, `/api/chat` should return `503`. Exercise story delivery with
a test webhook rather than sending test submissions to the production inbox.

### 6. Scripts and release integrity

`python3 scripts/test_operations_scripts.py` checks admin JSON fields, fleet
partial-failure exit status and smoke-file ownership using stub transports. It
makes no network request, writes no login token and updates no host.

```bash
make benchmark-wrapper-test        # python3 -m unittest discover -s gemma_contbatch/tests -t .   (in scripts/)
./scripts/check-release-version.sh # ProviderCore.version == coordinator LatestProviderVersion (see operations/provider-release.md)
python3 scripts/check-go-toolchain.py # exact local/container pins satisfy go.mod
python3 scripts/test-go-toolchain.py  # old production mismatch, patch minimum, drift and digest regressions
python3 scripts/test-provider-release-resolution.py # signed-validation and publication routing before credentials
./scripts/sync-install-embed.sh check   # coordinator/api/install.sh byte-identical to scripts/install.sh
./scripts/test-prod-env-refresh.sh      # deploy/gcp/prod/refresh-env.sh contract
./scripts/test-setup-macos-homebrew.sh  # scripts/setup-macos-homebrew.sh with brew already installed
./scripts/test-publish-model.sh         # scripts/publish-model.sh dry-run contract
```

Version checks, release routing, installer parity and production environment refresh
run in CI job "Release Integrity". The production env refresh test checks automatic
payout activation, preservation of an explicit off switch, and rejection of missing
payout prerequisites before the live env is changed. It also verifies that the
required soft-delete mutation flag bootstraps to `false` while preserving explicit
`false` and `true` choices. These tests use temporary env files, not production.

The Go toolchain guard runs without Docker or a Go download. Its regression suite
rejects the former Go 1.25 builder with the Go 1.26 module, mismatched local pins,
an insufficient patch version and an absent digest; it also executes the guard
against the checkout. This is not a substitute for the full production Docker
build in [the build guide](build.md#9-coordinator-container-image).

For a provider version-only preparation, run source/fallback parity and the
release-script tests without cold-building Swift/MLX. Inspect existing caches
first; reuse Go's content-addressed caches and only compatible Swift/Metal
caches. Do not point a separate worktree at another active Swift scratch path or
present an old binary as the new candidate. A changed checkout path, SDK,
compiler or dependency pin can invalidate Swift build reuse. Exact signed-bundle
runtime, numerical and upgrade checks remain required by the
[0.9.18 rollout gates](../operations/provider-release.md#0918-candidate-rollout).

For GPT-OSS profiling, first build a release benchmark binary and identify its
loaded Metal library and the exact downloaded model snapshot. Run on an idle
Apple Silicon host; the runner executes one cell process at a time and records
host state before and after each cell. The runner does not build or stop other
processes. Set the paths below to those artifacts, then run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/gptoss_profile/tests -v
python3 scripts/profile-gptoss.py run \
  --binary "$GPTOSS_BENCHMARK_BINARY" --metallib "$GPTOSS_METALLIB" \
  --model-dir "$GPTOSS_MODEL_SNAPSHOT" --output artifacts/gptoss-profile/baseline \
  --phase decode --cells decode-512-b1,decode-512-b2,decode-512-b4
python3 scripts/profile-gptoss.py summarize artifacts/gptoss-profile/baseline
```

Omit `--phase` and `--cells` for the full prefill/decode/arrival matrix; defaults
are five measured repetitions and 256 decode tokens. Prefix caching and MTP
are absent from the benchmark factory. The wrapper also disables their process
flags, clears inherited experimental controls, and uses an empty default TOML
unless `--config` is supplied. `--build-receipt` records the supplied build
receipt hash; the current source fingerprint alone does not establish how a
binary was built. The matrix manifest pins the iteration count, decode budget,
and KV backend; changing any of these requires a new output directory, even
when adding different cell names. The binary, metallibs, config, build receipt,
and full model inventory/content hashes are rechecked before and after each
new cell, outside its timing interval. Source: `scripts/gptoss_profile/runner.py` (`execute`),
`scripts/gptoss_profile/config.py` (`cells`, `environment`).

Verify `summary.json` has no failed cells and inspect `summary.csv`,
`summary.md`, and the raw per-cell output. Decode headlines use the common
host-observed interval in which every row is decoding, require at least 32
tokens from each row, and report aggregate/B separately from actual row rates.
This timing does not prove scheduler batch occupancy. Failed or changed
artifacts are not silently reused; use a new output directory for different
provenance or `--rerun` to archive and repeat an identical cell. Instrumented
runs require `--mode diagnostic` and a separate output directory. Source:
`scripts/gptoss_profile/validation.py` (`validate`),
`scripts/gptoss_profile/summary.py` (`summarize`).

For paired prefill or decode comparisons, create a schema-1 design with two
arms (`A`, `B`), explicit binary/metallib/build receipt paths, identical context
length and phase, and explicit environment overrides. Run
`PYTHONPATH=scripts python3 -m gptoss_profile.controls <design.json> --output <directory> --cycles 2`.
Prefill uses `cell: {"phase":"prefill","context":8192,"batch":1}` and compares
TTFT; decode compares aggregate common-window throughput and output hashes.
Prefill token parity is explicitly unavailable in this report schema. Keep
numerical/KV tests separate from uninstrumented timing. The decode warmup now
uses the requested generation length so long prompts can establish the full
batch before measured work. Failed construction, submission, terminals or token
counts in any warmup abort the sweep before decode measurements. Schema 7 submits requests in row-index order before
concurrently consuming their streams; validation checks the recorded order and
timestamps. Batched decode requires schema 7; historical schema-6 raw data remains
available but is rejected for new performance comparisons, including when
re-summarizing saved ABBA runs. Legacy single-row schema 6 remains accepted.
Scaling ratios also require matching backend, decode budget and iteration count
when reading older manifests without the matrix workload field.
This prevents task scheduling from silently changing admission order. Sources: `scripts/gptoss_profile/controls.py`
(`execute_controls`), `scripts/gptoss_profile/control_report.py`
(`summarize_controls`), `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ThroughputSweep.swift`
(`measureDecode`). See [GPT-OSS optimization results](../reports/2026-09-05-gptoss20b-optimization-results.md).

### 7. Docs lint

Long-prompt throughput qualification must retain both MLX active/cache counters
and an independent OS process-footprint sample. The sweep applies the serving
allocator guard before loading (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ThroughputSweep.swift`,
`run`); `MLXMemoryGuardTests` cover the shared limit policy. A large unbounded
reuse pool is not live KV. Rerun identical prompt/token budgets and compare token
IDs when changing allocation policy; do not reduce state precision to hide growth.

The lightweight Contribution Policy workflow runs before review and again when
the `docs-not-needed` label is added or removed. Its `Commit Signatures` job
queries GitHub's pull-request commit list and requires
`commit.verification.verified = true` for every commit. This covers commits on
contributor forks, which the protected branch's signed-commit rule does not
evaluate.

Its `Docs Impact` job runs:

```bash
make docs-impact-check BASE=origin/master
```

`scripts/docs-impact-check.py` compares the branch with the merge base and
applies `scripts/docs-impact-rules.json`. A documentation-sensitive source
change must update one of that rule's canonical docs. Matching multiple rules
requires satisfying each rule. Test-only files are ignored. A maintainer can
apply `docs-not-needed` when a mapped source change does not alter documented
behavior; the PR must explain the exception in its Documentation impact
section.

Run `python3 scripts/test-docs-impact-check.py` when changing source-to-doc
mappings. Its extracted-component cases require both the behavior-specific
canonical doc and the ownership doc: updating navigation alone must not satisfy
routing, cache, protocol, trust, telemetry or accounting requirements.

The historical-link and freshness-stamping regression checks run in isolated
temporary Git repositories:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-docs-check-historical-links.py
python3 scripts/test-docs-stamp.py
```

Docs Lint also runs these checks before validating the documentation tree.
Frozen source references resolve against the exact legacy commit recovered from
document history, or the particular link's introduction commit for new date-only
records, when the file has moved. Shallow history, invalid or missing provenance,
copied-record backdating, and current missing links still fail. Freshness dates
never select commits. Stamping tests check date preservation, unchanged body
evidence, tracked-file scope, and idempotence. See
[historical source references](historical-references.md).

```bash
make docs-check          # scripts/docs-check.sh — stamps, relative links, cited paths, orphans
make docs-stamp FILES="docs/developer/test.md"   # refresh a stamp after editing
scripts/docs-stamp.sh --from-git docs/reports/example.md   # preserve an existing date
```

### 8. End-to-end suite

The e2e package (`e2e/`, harness in `e2e/testbed/`) boots ephemeral Postgres,
a coordinator from the current tree, and one or more **real** `darkbloom`
provider processes serving MLX checkpoints, then drives the OpenAI-compatible
API. It is a Go test binary; run it from the repo root with `-p=1` (suites
share GPU/ports).

```bash
# Blocking lane as CI runs it (paged KV @ 8, engine-reported backend asserted):
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_KV_BACKEND=paged DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MAX_CONCURRENT=8 \
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND=paged \
go test ./e2e/ -count=1 -v -timeout 25m -p=1 \
  -run 'TestIntegration|TestProfile' -skip '^TestIntegrationExactCacheRouting$'

# Default posture (no TOML written; .auto resolves contiguous as of v0.8.1):
DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND=contiguous \
go test ./e2e/ -count=1 -v -timeout 10m -p=1 -run '^TestIntegration_(NonStreaming|Streaming)Inference$'

make e2e-integration     # go test ./e2e/... -run TestIntegration -v   (no posture pins)
make e2e-benchmark       # go test ./e2e/... -run TestBenchmark -v
```

#### E2E coverage in CI

The testbed runs the coordinator inside the test process
(`e2e/testbed/suite.go`, `startCoordinator` calls `api.NewServer`). There is no
coordinator binary to build with `go build -cover`. So CI adds coverage flags to
the `go test ./e2e/` command of each of the three lanes:
`-cover -covermode=set -coverpkg="$E2E_COVER_PKG"` and
`-args -test.gocoverdir=<dir>`, one directory per lane. The "Select e2e coverage
packages" step sets `E2E_COVER_PKG` to the `coordinator/...` packages without a
`tests`, `testkit` or `testdb` path segment, the same production set that
`scripts/run-coordinator-tests.py` instruments. `set` mode stores 1 per block
and is the cheapest mode, so the latency checks in the `TestProfile` tests see
the least extra work. The `-run`, `-skip`, `-timeout` and `-p` flags do not
change.

The "Report e2e coverage" step merges the lane directories with
`go tool covdata textfmt`, keeps the `coordinator/...` rows with
`scripts/coordinator-statement-coverage.sh` (the script that the Coordinator
Tests report also uses) and writes one row to the job summary:
`Coordinator (Go), e2e`, statements only, no target. The denominator is the
statements in the selected production packages that the e2e test binary links;
packages it does not link, such as `cmd/...`, are not counted. A lane that
fails or is skipped is left out, and the summary names the lanes that it
merged. A low number never fails the job. The step fails when a lane passed but
wrote no data, or when the merged data has no coordinator rows or no total.
The raw lane directories and the merged `e2e-coverage.out` are kept for 14 days
as the `coordinator-e2e-coverage` artifact.

The row is not merged with the unit number from the Coordinator Tests job. That
job runs in another workflow (`ci.yml`) on Linux, and both workflows start on
the same push with no order between them. To get a combined figure, download
both artifacts and take the union of covered blocks. To measure one lane
locally:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/e2e-cov
E2E_COVER_PKG=$(go list ./coordinator/... | grep -Ev '/(tests|testkit|testdb)(/|$)' | paste -sd, -)
go test ./e2e/ -count=1 -v -timeout 10m -p=1 \
  -cover -covermode=set -coverpkg="$E2E_COVER_PKG" \
  -run '^TestIntegration_(NonStreaming|Streaming)Inference$' \
  -args -test.gocoverdir=/tmp/e2e-cov
go tool covdata textfmt -i=/tmp/e2e-cov -o e2e-coverage.out
scripts/coordinator-statement-coverage.sh e2e-coverage.out e2e-coverage-coordinator.out
```

The harness builds the provider itself (`e2e/testbed/provider.go`,
`BuildProvider`): `swift build -c release` (or `TESTBED_PROVIDER_CONFIG=debug`)
and stages `mlx.metallib`, unless `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` points at a
binary that already has `mlx.metallib` beside it.

### 9. Prompt-contract parity fixtures and vectors

After building provider tests, run `./scripts/verify-nemotron-prompt-parity.sh`
for the separate Nemotron contract. CI runs this even if the general parity
step fails. It provisions only prompt metadata through the existing Go artifact
cache using `fixtures/prompt-contract/nemotron/manifests`, then requires the
Swift reference suite to execute without skips and explicitly runs the Rust
artifact-dependent reference and planner tests. The 25 original cases plus
seven numeric edge cases cover exact prompt bytes/tokens, including numeric
enum/minimum/default values, nested numbers and integral decoding. No weights,
generation, or GPU model qualification is involved.

`nemotron_number_vectors.json` contains 526 finite Double spellings captured by
`swift scripts/generate-nemotron-number-vectors.swift`; offline Swift and Rust
filter tests consume the same oracle. The edge corpus can be regenerated with
`python3 scripts/generate-nemotron-prompt-edges.py <pinned-model-directory>`;
it uses local-only Transformers after checking the template hash and mirrors
the SDK's typed numeric conversion before reference rendering.
`MediaToolMetadataTests` separately preserves non-Nemotron text/media metadata
policy without loading a model.

The `prompt-fixtures` generator writes pretty JSON without an extra final newline,
matching the checked-in production corpus. `verify-prompt-parity.sh` compares
bytes before cross-language tests; different EOF formatting fails even when parsed
tokens and contracts agree.

Before the MiMo Rust cases, use the [pinned metadata setup](mimo-prompt-fixtures.md).
`scripts/test-prepare-mimo-prompt-fixtures.py` tests its allowlist, exact hashes,
size limits and non-overwriting/no-symlink behavior without network access.
The actual setup fetches only four public metadata files and uses the unchanged
checked-in synthetic20-case corpus. It neither loads weights nor qualifies the
selected serving artifact's model generation or native API path.

For the registry-ID/native-context follow-up, run `Qwen4SupportPolicyTests`,
`Qwen4OwnedVLMRoutingTests`, `Qwen4ToolChoicePromptPolicyTests`,
`Qwen4ReasoningEffortValidationTests` and `PromptContractIdentityTests` against
the freshly built provider test product. These cover both exact serving IDs,
foreign-ID rejection, native prompt-plus-output boundaries, no second clamp on
other models, media factory selection and native tool/reasoning policy. Rust
`qwen4_native_tool_prompt` and Go `TestQwen4Catalog` tests cover the mirrors and
mixed-fleet version floor. Require nonzero executed counts and no hidden skips.

Normalization v6 requires regenerated contract/cache hashes; compare all
existing production vectors' request/provider bodies, template inputs and token
arrays against v5 before accepting the update. The shared corpus does not
include the full Flash-Next artifact: these checks are not full-model API,
262K memory, multimodal or MTP qualification. Record those gates separately.

`fixtures/prompt-contract/v1` is shared by the Rust, Go and Swift
prompt-contract tests: `contract_vectors.json` and `block_hash_vectors.json`
(identity and chain vectors), `corpus.json` (complete requests for tools, null
sanitization, Harmony and Gemma normalization, reasoning effort, Unicode, all
four endpoints, exact block multiples, long prompts, response formats and
multiple system turns),
`tool_choice_parallel_vectors.json` (16 exact required/named/auto/none
instruction cases across omitted/null/true/false parallel controls, consumed by
`CachePromptParityTests.parallelToolInstructionVectors` and Rust
`tool_choice_parallel.rs`),
`native_reasoning_vectors.json` (25 shared context/error cases for native
Qwen4 reasoning ON/OFF, typed effort precedence and legacy-model preservation,
consumed by `CachePromptParityTests.nativeReasoningContextVectors` and Rust
`cache_prompt_parity.rs`),
`production_vectors.json` (per-model normalized bodies, token IDs and
boundaries) and `manifests/` (the catalog snapshot the vectors were generated
from). Production tokenizer/template/config artifacts are **not** in the
repository; the vectors are generated only from manifest-pinned,
coordinator-provisioned artifacts. What the vectors protect is explained in
[`../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md`](../architecture/prompt-contract-sidecar.md#parity-fixtures-and-measured-latency).

The pinned inventory contains seven artifacts: the five release models and two
additional Gemma variants. All 18 shared cases run against every artifact,
producing 154 token-array and scoped-hash comparisons. The common corpus uses
histories and reasoning settings accepted by each family; family-specific argument and
Harmony regressions remain in the provider's focused test suites.

**Run the gate** (what CI's Provider Prompt Parity job runs; needs Go, `cargo +1.88.0`,
Swift and `jq`):

```bash
./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh
```

The script, in order:

1. Replays the committed manifest snapshot through
   `go run ./cmd/promptfixtureinput --manifest-source-directory
   fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/manifests …` (from `coordinator/`), which
   downloads only the verified prompt artifacts into a temporary artifact root
   (override with `PROMPT_PARITY_ARTIFACT_ROOT`; artifacts come from
   `PROMPT_PARITY_CDN_URL`).
2. Regenerates the vectors with the Rust generator:

   ```bash
   cargo +1.88.0 run --locked --quiet \
     --manifest-path coordinator/promptsidecar/Cargo.toml \
     --bin prompt-fixtures -- \
     --manifest-directory "$MANIFEST_DIR" \
     --artifact-root "$ARTIFACT_ROOT" \
     --cases fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/corpus.json \
     --output "$WORK/production_vectors.json"
   ```

   `prompt-fixtures` (`coordinator/promptsidecar/src/bin/prompt-fixtures.rs`)
   also accepts one `--manifest <file>` per model instead of
   `--manifest-directory`. The corpus supplies a fixed request-owned UTC date;
   direct literal date calls use it in both renderers. Unsupported clock use
   is written with `cache_routing_eligible: false` and
   `ineligibility_reason: "dynamic_time"` and get no routable vectors.
3. `cmp`s the generated file byte-for-byte against
   `fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/production_vectors.json`.
4. Runs the three implementations against the same vectors: Swift
   `swift test --package-path provider-swift --filter ProductionPromptParityTests`
   (with `PROMPT_PARITY_REQUIRED=1`, `PROMPT_PARITY_VECTORS`,
   `PROMPT_PARITY_ARTIFACT_ROOT` set), Go
   `go test ./tests/promptcontract -run TestProductionPlansConsumeSharedTokenVectors`,
   and Rust `--test shared_vectors production_plans_match_shared_token_vectors`
   plus `--test planner_fixture concurrent_cold_contract_load_is_singleflight`.
5. Builds the release `promptsidecar` and drives it through the real Go
   supervisor with `go run ./coordinator/cmd/promptsidecarloadproof`
   (`PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_DURATION`, `PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_QPS`,
   `PROMPT_LOAD_PROOF_MAX_RSS_MIB` tune the run), failing on any plan mismatch,
   timeout, overload, restart, child replacement or RSS escape.
   The cold-start phase rotates explicit one-contract preload sets through an
   undersized LRU, then runs concurrent plans only after acknowledgement. It
   checks every cold load and eviction, exact plans, bounded RSS and a stable
   child. It does not bypass production membership to force lazy planning;
   concurrent cold singleflight remains a separate Rust planner test above.
   Preserve the reported cold-load, preload and warm-plan timing totals and
   counts alongside memory measurements. Compute means from totals and counts;
   histogram buckets are cumulative bounds, not exact latency quantiles. When
   comparing tokenizer ownership, use identical artifacts, vectors and proof
   binaries in both arms. A macOS RSS pass does not prove Linux's address-space
   limit; run `scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh` against the static musl
   binary before release.

**Regenerate the fixtures** after a catalog, normalisation, renderer or
tokenizer change:

```bash
PROMPT_PARITY_UPDATE=1 ./scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh
```

This re-fetches every active public manifest from `PROMPT_PARITY_CATALOG_URL`
(default `https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models/catalog`), rewrites
`fixtures/prompt-contract/v1/manifests/` and `production_vectors.json`, then
runs the same parity tests against the new vectors. Commit both. Missing
models, artifacts or corpus cases and unrecognised template incompatibilities
fail the gate (`require_model_manifests`, `require_case_ids`); no fabricated
token IDs are accepted.

## CI workflow map

The CI, integration and benchmark workflows use the
[component-routing detector](#component-ci-routing). Component jobs run only for
relevant PR changes; policy checks remain unconditional. Default-branch pushes
keep full coverage. The required provider aggregate also passes verified
intentional skips for irrelevant PRs, rather than requiring unselected macOS jobs.

## Verify

- `make test` exits 0 and `docs-check` prints `N file(s) OK`.
- `swift test` output lists the `ProviderCore` suites **and** each nested suite
  step prints a non-zero executed count (the tripwire in `run-nested-suite.sh`).
- The e2e run logs `postgres started`, one `using configured provider binary`
  or provider build line per provider, and finishes with `ok  github.com/eigeninference/d-inference/e2e`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL not set — skipping PostgreSQL integration test` | store tests skipped | export `DATABASE_URL` to a Postgres 16 with a `testbed` database |
| `neither docker nor postgres found in PATH` | e2e cannot start Postgres | start Docker, or put `postgresql@16/bin` on `PATH` |
| `configured provider metallib not found beside binary` | `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY` set without `mlx.metallib` next to it | `./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh "$(dirname "$DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY")"` |
| provider never registers a model in e2e | checkpoint not in the HF cache, not CBv2-servable, or gated to other hardware (the Qwen3.8-27B builds need Apple M5 with NAX and the provider prints `No models selected.`) | download the pinned snapshot; check `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_MODEL` |
| nested suite step fails with "executed 0 tests" | swift-testing pass routed at an executable target / wrong filter | rebuild with `swift build --build-tests` in `libs/mlx-swift-lm`; keep suite names exact |

## GPT-OSS complete-checkpoint reconstruction

On an owned idle Apple Silicon host, build the optimized provider tests with the
pinned dependencies and source-matched metallib described in [build.md](build.md).
Point the fixture at the verified exact `gpt-oss-20b` catalog snapshot; the helper
hashes it before and after loading and rejects any other aggregate. Run only this
fixture, with MTP and resident caching left at their production defaults:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_CHECKPOINT_RESTART=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MODEL_DIRECTORY=/absolute/verified-gpt-oss-20b \
  swift test -c release --force-resolved-versions -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
    --no-parallel --filter GPTOSSCheckpointRestartLiveTests
```

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/GPTOSS/GPTOSSCheckpointRestartLiveTests.swift`
(`sameKeyNewEngineRestoresBranchedPrompt`; the same file also gates
`batchedDonorRestoresDeepBoundary`, whose donor starts solo and gains decode
company and must restore at least 5,120 of about 6,400 tokens,
`growingConversationRestoresDeepest`, and `forkedPromptRestoresHintedBoundary`,
which restores the boundary a coordinator hint named) donates a complete encrypted historical
checkpoint, shuts down the engine/store, reconstructs both and requests a branched
prompt first. It requires disk reads, exact checkpoint-boundary hit accounting,
expected answer markers, tenant and changed-prefix misses, cache-off controls,
and retired staging/write reservations. TTFT and exact-text equality are recorded;
one run is not a general performance or answer-quality claim. The fixture uses
an isolated temporary root, one ephemeral key retained across reconstruction,
and test runtime identity. It does not prove provider-process restart, production
keychain recovery or cross-binary reuse.

For concurrent requests with different suffixes, run the separate mixed-prefix
gate on the same owned host, with production TF32 defaults:

```bash
cd provider-swift
env -u MLX_ENABLE_TF32 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MIXED_PREFIX=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_GPTOSS_MODEL_DIRECTORY=/absolute/verified-gpt-oss-20b \
  swift test -c release --force-resolved-versions -Xswiftc -enable-testing \
    --no-parallel --filter GPTOSSMixedPrefixCacheLiveTests
```

The model-directory variable is optional when the exact verified snapshot is
already discoverable in the local cache.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/GPTOSS/GPTOSSMixedPrefixCacheLiveTests.swift`
(`concurrentSuffixesRemainIsolated`) compares cache-off controls with restored
branches in B2/B4 cohorts, reverses the B2 request order, and submits a four-request
mixture of matching prefixes, a changed early fact and another tenant.
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Fixtures/GPTOSSMixedPrefixCohort.swift` (`run`)
submits through the real bridge and requires completed native target-decode
observations at widths two and four for the restored B2/B4 cohorts. The cold
`off-four-submitted` control and mixed four-request cohorts require at least
width two: full prefills can stagger short natural answers, so four admissions
do not establish cold decode width four. All observed widths remain in the
retained deltas. This semantic/isolation gate does not establish matched
full-width-four cache-on/cache-off parity or performance; paired performance
benchmarks retain their own actual-width requirements. Each warm cohort must
restore both distinct suffixes; extra duplicate rows may safely miss. Store
consumptions must reconcile with observed hits. Every request must return its
own answer and hit/miss accounting, finish naturally and retire admission/KV
reservations. The same ephemeral-key limits
apply. First-observed chunk times can include buffered output and are not
benchmark TTFT; exact-text comparisons are diagnostic. This invocation describes
the gate and does not assert that it passed.

The focused construction and load-policy suites are `GPTOSSDefaultPrefixCacheWiringTests`,
`PrefixCachePolicyTests` and `PrefixCacheLoadHashTests` in
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/PrefixCache/`. They cover exact-ID activation, disabled
and unsupported backends, fresh load hashes and identity rejection. A passing
construction suite does not replace the real-checkpoint fixture above. Live test
skips must be reported as unrun qualification.

## Model prefix latency and throughput qualification (live)

`NemotronDemandedShortCheckpointTests` checks the qualified short-serving gate
with real small model classes and empty SSD stores: exact catalog and aggregate,
recurrent state, layout and floor; aliases, replacement weights and long-serving
partitions stay excluded. `BonsaiDemandedShortCheckpointTests` uses real small wrapper/store witnesses
to check the exact Bonsai ID/aggregate, recurrent state, backend/floor, absent MTP
capability, aliases/replacement weights and unchanged short-only construction.
Host policy tests do not replace fresh actual-artifact production verification.
`SSDCheckpointDonationHashTests` checks real chain
endpoints and authenticated tags, bounded work, ordinary/diffusion endpoint rules,
invalid geometry and scope/key isolation. Existing encrypted-store write/read,
duplicate and demand suites cover their integration.

`SSDCheckpointDonationHashBenchmarkTests` is a separate opt-in CPU measurement.
Set `DARKBLOOM_DONATION_HASH_BENCHMARK=1`, an absolute new
`DARKBLOOM_DONATION_HASH_BENCHMARK_OUTPUT`, and an absolute
`DARKBLOOM_DONATION_HASH_BENCHMARK_IDENTITY` JSON containing the actual compiler
version, bundle SHA-256, source revision and source-snapshot SHA-256. Retain an
independent receipt verifying those caller-supplied identities before and after.
It compares real hash/HMAC work in twelve counterbalanced pairs per synthetic
cell, verifies exact addresses, and includes a deepest-only control. Run it in
a quiet CPU lane using the already-built matched runner; its results measure
hash preparation rather than a complete write job, model TTFT or GPU throughput.

The opt-in `ModelPrefixBenchmarkLiveTests` suite loads one exact catalog
artifact, hashes its payload before and after load, binds the source-matched
runtime metallib, and uses the actual production factory and KV grant. Run it
alone on an idle owned GPU after `make provider-test` has built and staged the
test runner. Model hardware and load requirements still apply; the concrete
Qwen3.8 builds require their normal runtime capabilities.

Create a JSON specification for the owned artifact, substituting its exact
catalog hash and absolute paths:

```json
{
  "modelID": "Qwen3.5-9B",
  "openRouterID": "qwen/qwen3.5-9b",
  "directory": "/path/to/current/model",
  "expectedWeightHash": "<exact catalog SHA-256>",
  "modelType": "qwen3_5",
  "outputPath": "/path/to/owned/results.json",
  "pairs": 3,
  "outputTokens": 128,
  "cases": [{
    "name": "short", "donorTokens": 1793, "sharedTokens": 1152,
    "forkTokens": 2304, "demandedTokens": 1024
  }]
}
```

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_MODEL_BENCHMARK=1 DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_EXCLUSIVE_GPU=1 \
DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_MODEL_SPEC=/path/to/owned/specification.json \
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel --filter ModelPrefixBenchmarkLiveTests
```

Each pair contains an identical cold fork, a novel donor with zero demand,
a demanded donor and its warm fork, in counterbalanced order and separate
scopes. Fixed greedy token IDs and exact output hashes establish output parity;
actual restored-token usage and SSD read counters establish physical reuse.
Cells with zero restored tokens demonstrate no cache reuse. These probes do
not qualify chat quality or answer correctness. TTFT begins before
submission and includes staging. Generation TPS is `(output tokens - tokens
in the first nonempty event) / (last-event time - first-event time)`. It is
undefined for a single output event; MTP may emit multiple IDs per event.
End-to-end TPS ends at the terminal event. Receipt completion ends when
`session.complete` returns after receipt retirement and stage refunds.
For the observed COMPLETE layouts, terminal delivery already waits for
checkpoint publication. A separate quiescence rate explicitly waits for
engine idle and the owned checkpoint writer/activity barriers; its recorded
receipt-to-quiescence tail does not change the earlier timestamps. These
serialized request rates do not measure saturated throughput or fsync durability.
The JSON retains every completed row, actual restored tokens, file reads and
writes, donor cost, and exact-output comparisons, including failed comparisons.

`mtpEnabled` defaults to `false`; set it explicitly to qualify the actual
assistant-bearing serving configuration. The factory must load and activate
the real assistant. Each row records active snapshots and actual drafting,
emission and serial/rectangular verification deltas; an enabled setting or a
configured verification mode alone cannot pass. `pairOffset` defaults to zero
and preserves counterbalanced request order across separate processes.

An optional `checkpointPartition` value of
`demanded_recurrent_qualification` exercises the benchmark-only broader and
longer recurrent partition. Compare it against a separate `production` run
with identical cells and artifacts. Its cache-on/off comparison alone does
not measure an improvement over shipping code. Native historical models do
not use this override. Run every model sequentially and retain unsupported
hardware, load refusals and parity failures as unqualified results.

For a same-original-donor adjacent-frontier correctness witness, a case may add:

```json
{
  "name": "long", "donorTokens": 16513, "sharedTokens": 14464,
  "forkTokens": 16896, "demandedTokens": 14336,
  "adjacentFork": {
    "sharedTokens": 16400, "forkTokens": 16896,
    "expectedRestoredTokens": 16384
  }
}
```

The optional object preserves old four-role specifications. It appends
`adjacent_warm_fork` and `adjacent_cold_fork` after the original four rows, using
that original donor's literal session/store/scope and hint. Actual input lengths,
shared prefix and first divergence are validated before import. No second donor,
new target hint, reconstructed checkpoint or memory-cache substitute qualifies.
After idle/write/activity joins, cumulative archive counters must match the
original donor's positive row delta and remain unchanged across all five
non-donor rows. Both requested boundaries need exact cold/warm and cross-policy
output equality, real file/byte reads, exact expected restoration and replay
zero. Every MTP-on row still needs actual active work counters.

The two appended rows have fixed warm-before-cold order and are correctness
witnesses, excluded from the counterbalanced 256-ID donor-plus-middle-warm
economic denominator. Four `ModelPrefixBenchmarkAdjacentForkTests` host methods
cover optional/bounded spec decoding, actual divergence, monotonic donor counter
proof and hidden/intervening writes. Eight independent pure qualification
controls additionally reject missing/wrong-order rows, fabricated comparison
booleans, degraded middle/adjacent payloads, changed donor hints, MTP/drain
failures and uncharged extra ranges. These controls are separate from native
execution; report executed counts and retain unrun native gates.

`CBv2DemandedCheckpointContinuationTests` is a required seven-method SDK scheduler/tiny-fixture
suite, independent of full-model/native qualification. It checks exact ordinary
and split geometry/three retained roles, live versus projected in-flight work,
rollback/retry, aligned and terminal targets, real striped admission fallback,
pause versus incompatible progress, and preemption/capture disarm. It must run
without an opt-in environment gate through the nonempty/no-skip wrapper:

```bash
cd libs/mlx-swift-lm
../../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh CBv2DemandedCheckpointContinuationTests --no-parallel
```

The source-matched test binary and Metal must already be built/staged; some
regression paths evaluate small synthetic MLX graphs. Preserve
existing short partition/range/preemption/packed/capacity, first-content
projection/deadline and native-retention gates. The benchmark-only long flag
stays off in serving; passing host geometry does not establish an SSD archive,
full-model output parity or a policy speedup. Use three fresh source-bound
policy blocks and the same-original-donor adjacent proof before a separate
long-serving decision.

For a geometry diagnostic, specify `soloPrefillStripeTokens` explicitly in
the JSON. The isolated factory does not forward arbitrary process overrides.
Every row records the effective scheduler configuration and observed prefill
chunk count; verify both before describing a comparison as matched.
`captureTokenDiagnostics: true` records actual generated IDs, selected
log-probabilities and top-two margins for those positions. Keep this raw
diagnostic output private and publish only curated equality/finite-value
results. Its additional observation work excludes its timings from performance
comparisons; a matching recorded slice does not certify every state tensor.
Requesting top logprobs disables active MTP in its normal eligibility gate, so
this diagnostic must not be presented as the same MTP execution. Equal prefill
chunk counts alone also do not control adaptive MTP width/cost history.

## Qwen recurrent checkpoint retention (live)

`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Qwen/Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests.swift`
drives real Qwen weights through the production paged assembly (bridge, SSD
complete-checkpoint store, inline MTP head when the artifact embeds one) and
checks chunk-agnostic capture, fork-target retention, restore text against a
cold control, and the company-leaves shape (six 512-token chunks, then the
2,048-token stripe). Gates and overrides:

```bash
cd provider-swift
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
swift test --filter Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests
# MoE sanity run (needs both gates):
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN36_MOE_CHECKPOINT=1 \
swift test --filter Qwen35CheckpointRetentionLiveTests/moePartitionSanity
```

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_RETENTION_MODEL` | Another cached `qwen3_5` checkpoint for the dense runs (default `EigenLabs/Qwen3.5-9B-MLX-4bit-mtp`). A `language_model_only` artifact loads without VLM extraction |
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_MOE_MODEL` | Another cached `qwen3_5_moe` checkpoint for the MoE run (default Qwen3.6-35B-A3B; Qwen3.5-35B-A3B is the same architecture) |
| `DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN_RETENTION_BUDGET_GIB` | Dense-run slot budget in GiB (default 32) |

The suite pins the solo stripe at 2,048 tokens; production dense Qwen stripes
at 4,096. `EigenLabs/Qwen3.8-27B-MTP-4bit` is the standalone MTP-head
artifact, not a model; and the Qwen3.8-27B builds are gated to Apple M5 with
NAX in the provider (`ModelRuntimeRequirements`), so on other chips the
fixture bypasses a product gate and trips the 30-second engine step watchdog
in prefill. Results and the parity evidence behind the capture rule:
[2026-09-27 report](../reports/2026-09-27-qwen-chunk-partition-parity.md).

Two focused suites use the same cached dense model, opt-in gates and isolated
encrypted SSD fixture. `Qwen35AdjacentCheckpointLiveTests` creates a demanded
fork, withholds its file to reproduce the old publication outcome, and compares
restored-token counts and exact output after store/engine restarts. It uses a
1,024-token test stripe. `Qwen35DemandedShortCheckpointLiveTests` uses the
production 4,096-token stripe to compare novel, demanded-cold and warm-fork
requests below that stripe. Each prints native TTFT, accounting and donation
costs; neither substitutes for fleet or load testing.

```bash
cd provider-swift
# Build and stage source-matched metallibs with make provider-test first.
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel --filter Qwen35AdjacentCheckpointLiveTests
DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_TESTS=1 DARKBLOOM_LIVE_MLX_QWEN35_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION=1 \
swift test --skip-build --no-parallel --filter Qwen35DemandedShortCheckpointLiveTests
```

Run GPU suites sequentially and report opt-in skips as unrun. The
[candidate qualification report](../reports/2026-10-03-prefix-cache-qualification.md)
distinguishes the local paired archive result from the production baseline.

The report also retains a verification-only
[`qwen-mixed-benchmark.swift`](../reports/evidence/prefix-qualification-2026-10-03/qwen-mixed-benchmark.swift)
snapshot for the three mixed cold pairs and separate MTP-off warm fork. To
reproduce the historical result, use an isolated worktree with the report's
recorded source and dependency pins, then temporarily copy it into
`provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Inference/Live/Qwen/` with the filename
`Qwen35MixedCheckpointBenchmark.swift`,
build the tests and stage the matching metallib, then run the two selectors
sequentially. Remove that temporary file afterwards, rebuild the original test
target and stage its metallib again. Cached Qwen weights are required; use an
idle owned host and retain every cell, including failed measurements.

```bash
cd provider-swift
mkdir -p /tmp/darkbloom-cache-performance-validation
swift build --build-tests
../scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh .build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug
DARKBLOOM_MIXED_CHECKPOINT_BENCHMARK=1 \
  DARKBLOOM_MIXED_CHECKPOINT_BENCHMARK_OUTPUT=/tmp/qwen-mixed-cohort.json \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh realMixedCohort --no-parallel
DARKBLOOM_MIXED_WARM_BENCHMARK=1 \
  ../scripts/run-nested-suite.sh realMixedWarmFork --no-parallel
```

The warm fixture writes to
`/tmp/darkbloom-cache-performance-validation/qwen-mixed-warm.json`.
This fixture uses explicit width/stripe/budget settings and forced output
lengths. Every native timing fixture in the report uses `strictFsync=false`:
write completion is not fsync durability, and OS file-cache versus physical
storage effects are not separated. The mixed control does not pack, so its
delta measures capture creation rather than isolated packing overhead.

## Connected coordinator/provider HTTP cache gate

For a focused release-default check, use
`e2e/release_defaults_http_test.go` (`TestIntegrationReleaseDefaultsHTTP`).
Prepare an exact artifact/runtime input using the shared connected input schema,
with backend and MTP mode both `auto` and the model's expected cache mode. Leave
provider cache overrides unset. Run on one owned idle host:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_DEFAULT_INPUT=/absolute/defaults.json \
DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-defaults-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationReleaseDefaultsHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=15m
```

The two B1 requests check actual paged activation, automatic MTP selection,
complete cold/repeat output and token accounting, and model-scoped cache
capability. Qwen, exact `gpt-oss-20b` and `ternary-bonsai-2-27b` require a ready
SSD capability and an accepted repeat hit; GPT-OSS and Bonsai still require MTP inactivity under automatic
selection. The older Gemma QAT helper retains its cache-inactive expectation and
does not qualify the current Gemma default. The report retains the actual
generated provider configuration. This smoke does not establish raw token-ID
parity, concurrent widths, cancellation, restart, or selection between providers;
run the corresponding native and connected gates separately. CPU helper checks:

Install each controller with `SetPromptPreloadController` before calling
`PreloadController.Start`, including fresh controllers after a sidecar restart.
The shared `startExactCacheSidecar` fixture follows this production ordering.
An already-started controller is deliberately rejected: successful native
preload alone does not establish API readiness or current Registry participation.
With the same immutable input and verified Rust sidecar, the CPU-only
`TestExactCacheSidecarPublishesAPIReadiness` regression checks all three, and
rejects a demand identity missing its catalog generation. It never loads a
provider or model:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_DEFAULT_INPUT=/absolute/defaults.json \
  go test -short ./e2e -run '^TestExactCacheSidecarPublishesAPIReadiness$' -count=1
```

```bash
go test -short ./e2e ./e2e/testbed \
  -run 'TestReleaseDefault|TestReleaseCapability|TestProviderLaunchDefaultCache' -count=1
```

For the remaining release tools and image paths, use
`e2e/release_capabilities_http_test.go` (`TestIntegrationReleaseCapabilitiesHTTP`)
with the same exact connected input schema. Set
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CAPABILITIES_INPUT` and
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CAPABILITIES_OUTPUT` to the frozen input and a fresh output
directory, then select that test explicitly. It runs one original tool request
for each selected model and one hash-bound image request for Qwen 3.5, Qwen 3.6
or Gemma QAT; GPT-OSS has no image case. Run each model separately on the owned
host. The shared setup preserves automatic backend/MTP and model-scoped cache
defaults. The test validates complete tool arguments, image-path handling,
stream termination and token accounting. Qwen 3.8 is excluded from this bounded
supplement because its full connected routing fixture already includes tools
and vision. Neither test's process success constitutes broad answer-quality
acceptance; apply the [release acceptance criteria](../design/release-090-acceptance.md).

The opt-in `ReleaseCoResidencyLiveTests` suite covers the exact Qwen 3.6,
GPT-OSS 20B and Gemma 4 QAT artifacts in three live slots. Set
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CORESIDENCY_CONFIG` to the reviewed fixture and
`DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_CORESIDENCY_CONFIG_SHA256` to its SHA256, then select only
`ReleaseCoResidencyLiveTests` in the separately built, owned test runner.
The fixture binds model paths, canonical prompt tokens, metallib and isolated
ephemeral cache paths; its declared operator memory cap must match the
environment. It uses detected hardware and normal admission/MTP/cache policy.
After measured Qwen SSD prefix consumption, it requires real generation during
each newcomer load and grant shrink, then cancellation, reservation drain,
recovery and grant growth after unload. Cleanup is awaited on failure as well
as success. This checks generation/load overlap after restore, not concurrent
SSD I/O. The suite skips ordinary CI when no fixture is supplied; a release run
must execute its one test with no skips and retain the complete cleanup report.
The harness is prepared; these instructions do not claim a completed live run.

Owned two-host startup waits up to five minutes for the existing GPU ≤42°C
and load1 ≤4 entry thresholds. Identity, disk, nonfinite measurements and
foreign processes still refuse immediately. Lease pings and cancellation
cover preparation; EOF, stop, signals or deadlines prevent a later launch.
The owned credential is retired after its provider group is confirmed gone,
before independent host observation. A foreign-process or telemetry failure
still fails the run; `auth_token_retired` and the separate owned
`credential-retirement.json` record keep credential cleanup distinct.

Catalog inputs use `testbed.CatalogModel.Entry` (`store.ModelRegistryEntry`),
not the public API projection from `catalogModelFromRegistryRecord`. Prepare
inputs through the opt-in, CPU-only `TestPrepareConnectedInputBindings` check
with `DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_INPUT_BINDING_PLAN`. It retains the original public
metadata, checks the complete input/report roundtrip, and preserves all
consumed policy fields and the immutable manifest. Catalog comparison remains
part of the exact input gate; ignored public fields must not be silently lost.

Reports retain `host_lifecycles` for failed and unattempted targets, including
readiness observations, helper/fixture identities, `provider_started`, and
terminal/cleanup receipts. A valid terminal can prove provider startup when its
start acknowledgement was lost; successful startup still requires the acknowledgement.
Without an acknowledgement or valid terminal, `provider_started` is null.
Contradictory identities remain explicit errors; an acknowledged start stays recorded.
A started Go/helper fixture is not evidence that
a provider started, and a refused startup remains a failed correctness run.


`TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP` extends the existing real-provider testbed with
an opt-in ten-case HTTP gate. It starts an isolated in-memory coordinator, two
normal authenticated provider WebSocket connections, and the real supervised Rust
prompt sidecar. Local API keys, provider tokens and the routing master key are
fresh fixture credentials. No production database, Privy, Stripe or deployment
secret is needed. Testbed trust overrides are explicit; this is not attestation or
persistent-key restart evidence. Two providers on one Mac establish connected
control-plane behavior, not independent-machine capacity or latency.

For two independent machines, supply the optional `providers` array described
in the [owned-host fixture reference](../../e2e/testbed/OWNED_HOSTS.md). This uses
the existing loopback relay and owned SSH tunnel, and selects the five-case
`two_host_base_routing` scope. Follow its exact runtime/model inventories,
account binding, fresh-root and entry/cleanup requirements. The
[source integration record](../reports/2026-09-06-two-host-connected-fixture.md)
contains the CPU/race results; it is not an actual two-host model run.

Prepare `DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT` as the JSON input described by
`connectedCacheInput` in `e2e/connected_cache_input_test.go`: exact target catalog
entry and immutable manifest, current artifact tuple, verified prompt artifact
directory, provider/metallib/sidecar paths and SHA-256 values, explicit backend,
`cache_mode` (`off` or `ssd`), normal MTP mode, authored text/tool fixtures and
per-slot concurrency. Gemma requires its verified flat assistant directory and
an external assistant catalog manifest; the directory itself contains only
config and safetensors files. GPT-OSS uses MTP off and the three exact Qwen models
use MTP on. The normal production loader still verifies assistant compatibility.
Vision-configured artifacts require the original `landing/assets/cube-hero.png`
fixture and its pinned hash. The supplied text must tokenize to at least 2,048
tokens through the real sidecar, leaving room above the unchanged SSD hit floor.
No latest-snapshot discovery or artifact-name substitution occurs.
For the exact prepared five-artifact package, use ordinary `tool_choice: auto`
with explicit call instructions; the fixture checks actual tool name and arguments.
None of these exact artifacts advertises enforced named constraints, including
the Gemma artifact whose template differs from the pinned constraint contract.
Use the [reviewed revision 2 inputs](../reports/2026-09-05-connected-cache-inputs-revision2.md)
for the corrected Gemma assistant path and SSE reasoning-alias reader. Its
launcher verifies the actual declared assistant directory against the external
manifest. The package retains the original CLI/native revision; final release
validation requires a fresh paired package with the final runtime hashes.
Regenerate and review inputs plus CPU plans if the request-owned UTC date changes;
keep frozen packages and failed connected evidence unchanged.

Use a dedicated idle host and the final prebuilt provider plus colocated runtime
resources and Rust sidecar. This gate never builds them. It requires an existing
canonical provider config, verifies its bytes remain unchanged, and refuses a
provider binary with keychain access-group entitlement. Runtime files are copied
into the new output directory; PID/state/local discovery/cache/temporary/guard
paths are isolated, automatic updates and restarts are disabled, and the two exact
retired telemetry queue files must be absent. It never removes or repairs a host
configuration or key. SSD uses an explicitly ephemeral test key and fresh per-process
roots; resident cache and unrelated memory/backend overrides must be unset.

```bash
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT=/absolute/off.json \
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-off-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=45m
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_INPUT=/absolute/ssd.json \
DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-ssd-output \
  go test ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheHTTP$' -count=1 -timeout=45m
python3 scripts/benchmarks/compare_connected_cache_http.py \
  /absolute/new-off-output/report.json /absolute/new-ssd-output/report.json \
  --output /absolute/connected-comparison.json
```

The pair must use the same final binary, exact artifacts, backend, normal MTP,
authored request bytes and coordinator-owned UTC date. The comparator checks
served content/reasoning, decoded tool arguments, finish and native/HTTP token
counts; timing-dependent cancellation partial lengths are retained separately.
The runner fences UTC rollover and preserves failed, running and unrun cells in
an atomically replaced partial JSON report. Keep the `go test` log beside it for
setup failures and interrupted process evidence.

A bounded transparent loopback relay records negotiation, checkpoint echo,
receipt positions, cancellation and typed terminal usage/profile without keys,
nonces, raw scopes, token-chain hashes or encrypted bodies. Actual coordinator
acceptance counters and existing scheduler decisions are checked separately.
A read/receipt alone cannot pass the native saved-token hit assertion. The cases
cover cold donation, repeat, tenant isolation, a continuation on another provider,
original-prefix routing, supported tool execution, vision remaining cold, restored
cancellation and recovery, and sidecar-unavailable cold serving. Loaded slots must
report the actual backend with no fallback, and terminal profiles must prove MTP.
Heartbeat memory/SSD read observations are snapshots, not per-request read-byte
measurements. Old-echo, expiry/eviction, reconnect, queued revocation and costly-hit
winner controls remain separate coordinator gates. This harness source and its
loopback fixtures do not themselves establish real-model results.

The [HTTP6 execution record](../reports/2026-09-06-connected-http6-canceled-prefix.md)
passes all ten Qwen3.8 cache-off and SSD cases with the unchanged strict comparator.
Cancellation preserves actual SSD adoption and its accepted lookup before one
terminal; recovery and sidecar outage also pass. This is one B1 pair on one host.

The [HTTP5 execution record](../reports/2026-09-06-connected-http5-cache-and-cancel.md)
retains real donation/hit coverage and the original canceled-settlement failure.
Frozen package verification includes executable permissions before model preflight.
The [cancellation settlement regression](../reports/2026-09-06-canceled-prefix-settlement.md)
records the deterministic real-engine negative control and passing provider fix.
Run `ProviderCancelledPrefixCacheTests` and `CancelledSettlementLifecycleTests` to
check native usage/lookup ordering, delivered-token billing, and pump retirement;
the separate real-model HTTP rerun remains required.

The helper checks run without Swift, Metal or model execution:

```bash
go test -race -short ./e2e/testbed ./e2e \
  -run 'TestProviderWire|TestProviderTOMLExplicit|TestConnected' -count=1
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/benchmarks \
  -p 'test_compare_connected_cache_http.py'
```

### Two-host correctness-only continuation

Use `TestIntegrationConnectedCacheCorrectnessHTTP` when validating cache routing
and cancellation across two owned hosts. Prepare the same exact artifact/runtime
inputs and fresh roots described above, with two `providers` and explicit
`correctness_only: true`. Reserve both hosts before running; the existing cold
prelaunch, production admission and owned-process cleanup requirements still apply.

1. Run the cache-off input with the dedicated correctness variables:

   ```bash
   DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_CORRECTNESS_INPUT=/absolute/correctness-off.json \
   DARKBLOOM_CONNECTED_CACHE_CORRECTNESS_OUTPUT=/absolute/new-correctness-off \
     go test -v ./e2e -run '^TestIntegrationConnectedCacheCorrectnessHTTP$' \
       -count=1 -timeout=25m
   ```

2. After cache-off passes, repeat with the paired SSD input, identical runtime,
   artifact and UTC date, and separate fresh provider/output roots. Stop on any
   failure and retain its original report and cleanup receipts.
3. Require report schema `3`, scope `two_host_cache_routing_correctness`, and seven
   passing cases: `cold_donor_a`, `same_prompt_a`, `tenant_isolation_a`,
   `continuation_b`, `original_after_continuation`, `cancel`, `after_cancel`.
   Compare content, reasoning, finish reason and HTTP/native counts for the six
   completed requests. Both canceled requests must independently prove native
   partial settlement and retirement; their streamed partial lengths may differ.

Between requests, this scope retains heat/load observations and requires owned
processes only, exact hardware/RAM, valid telemetry, free disk space and quiescent
model capacity. It does not require running providers to return to cold benchmark
heat/load thresholds (`e2e/connected_cache_correctness_test.go`,
`connectedHostEntryReady`; `connectedSlotsQuiescent`). Cache adoption, tenant,
capability, request/provider identity and cancellation validators remain shared
with the original fixture (`e2e/connected_cache_http_test.go`,
`runConnectedCacheHTTP`). This scope makes no latency, throughput, raw-token-ID,
production-attestation or persistent-key restart claim. The original measured
fixture rejects `correctness_only: true`; preserve its schema-2 evidence and use
a separately reviewed schema-3 comparator for this seven-case pair.

## App Attest release qualification

Run `go test ./tests/appattest/... ./tests/api/... ./tests/store/... -run 'TestAppAttest|TestAuthorization|TestApple'`
from `coordinator/`, using a disposable local `DATABASE_URL` for the store
contracts (the test harness truncates tables). Add `-race` for concurrency checks.
Run `swift test --filter ProviderAppAttestTests` from `provider-swift/`.
The private admin queries have PostgreSQL coverage in
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest.test.ts` and
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest-diagnostics.test.ts`. These cover account-scoped
rotation recovery and aging historical APNs snapshots. `DeviceCheckProcessTests`
executes a child that ignores SIGTERM to verify bounded log collection.
`DeviceCheckExtractionBoundsTests` covers bounded file tails, oversized lines and
ring ordering; `ProviderRunMarkerTests` separates stale version markers from exact
exec identity, and informational doctor results remain non-failing under `--strict`.
`ReportPayloadTests` covers the combined upload-size limit, and an isolated idle
termination test checks that the run marker is clean before AppKit can exit.
`AppAttestLocalDiagnosisTests` covers APNs history below macOS 27 and missing
App Attest state.

After pushing a contribution, follow the [contributor skill](../../.agents/skills/darkbloom-contributor/SKILL.md#post-push-review-loop):
monitor reviews and checks on the current remote head, validate findings before
fixing them, and verify fixes are pushed before resolving threads. A passing
local suite does not establish that the post-push review cycle has completed.

After the optimized provider is packaged with its resources, run
`DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL=18 MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT=1 MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES=1 Darkbloom.app/Contents/MacOS/darkbloom runtime-smoke`
(the child validates retained latches that MLX reads at its first Metal touch,
so the caller seeds them, exactly as `SelfUpdater` and `install.sh` do). Require all four markers:
`app-attest-callback-runtime-smoke: ok`, `gemma-optimizations-runtime-smoke: ok`,
`paged-kernel-runtime-smoke: ok`, and `qwen4-metal-resources-runtime-smoke: ok`. The first line is
`build-environment-runtime-smoke: <prod|dev> coordinator=<url> cdn=<url>`. The release workflow
requires `<prod|dev>` to match the release environment. Callback completion and expiry are exercised
without Apple service calls or a Keychain item. This linked-binary check catches
a release-only allocator failure that debug tests missed. Run
`bash scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` for installer acceptance and rollback cases.
The [rollout runbook](../operations/app-attest-rollout.md) separates these checks
from real Apple receipt renewal and final signed-artifact fleet qualification.

## Provider release toolchain

`python3 scripts/test-provider-release-toolchain.py` checks SDK selection, rejection of older SDK/compiler inputs, wrapper argument boundaries and propagation of `SDKROOT` without installing software. Release Integrity runs these tests. The signed provider workflow runs the provider unit suite and isolated allocator gates with the selected SDK 27 / Swift 6.4 toolchain before packaging; [provider release](../operations/provider-release.md) describes artifact qualification.

### Qwen packaged resource regression

`python3 scripts/test-qwen4-packaged-resources.py` compiles the actual Qwen Metal resource accessor into a small optimized app, then runs it from a relocated app and an installer-style executable symlink. It checks all three preamble hashes, rejects missing or empty files and resource links outside the app, and proves that developer/cwd copies cannot mask a broken packaged resource. It needs Swift on macOS, but no model weights or GPU. Both SDK 27 release lanes and Provider Tests run this check. The full provider `runtime-smoke` exercises the same accessor before publication, installation, and update.

## Model token promotion and SLA checks

`coordinator/tests/api/inference/promotions/model_token_pricing_test.go` checks exact input/output prices, fee shares, mixed paid/sponsored requests, overflow rejection, and 100 tiny completions with a lost commit acknowledgement. `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/model_token_earnings_test.go` (`TestModelTokenPromotionFractionalEarningsAtomicAndDurable`) races fractional settlements and duplicate replays on both backends, rejects invalid fractions, and reopens PostgreSQL to verify remainder durability.

`coordinator/tests/store/contracts/model_token_promotions_test.go` runs the grant/ledger contract on both memory and disposable PostgreSQL backends: one-time claims, day boundaries, concurrent reservations, partial paid fallback, provider earnings, refund/settlement races, media top-ups and orphan recovery. Never point these tests at a production database: the store harness truncates tables. `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/model_token_zero_usage_test.go` (`TestModelTokenPromotionZeroUsageRejectsChargeAndPayout`) rejects payouts or charges with no token usage on both backends. `coordinator/tests/api/inference/promotions/model_token_reconciliation_test.go` injects pre-commit failures and lost commit acknowledgements, replays reconciliation concurrently, verifies usage/key-spend/referral/platform accounting once, and exercises deterministic cash failures caused by price increases or usage overages.

```sh
cd coordinator
DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER@127.0.0.1:PORT/THROWAWAY_DB?sslmode=disable' \
  go test -race ./tests/store/... -run TestModelTokenPromotion -count=1
go test -race ./tests/api/... ./tests/modelpolicy \
  -run 'Test(ModelTokenPromotion|ModelSpecificFirstContentDeadline|Bonsai|CustomFirstContent)' -count=1
```

`console-ui/src/components/app-providers/ModelTokenPromotionsProvider.test.tsx` covers read-only login discovery, explicit claims, sold-out/ineligible states, account-switch races and paid-fallback copy. `coordinator/tests/store/contracts/model_token_claims_test.go` (`TestModelTokenPromotionFirst250ClaimsAreAtomic`) races 270 distinct claimants against a 250-grant cap. The backend-private `model_token_claims_test.go` files in `coordinator/store/memory/` and `coordinator/store/postgres/` verify the persisted signup cutoff (`TestModelTokenPromotionSignupCutoffUsesPersistedCreationTime`). `console-ui/src/lib/chat/stream-thinking.test.ts` checks that frontend thinking defaults on. `console-ui/src/lib/chat/errors.test.ts` preserves promotion errors instead of replacing them with a generic credit error. `python3 scripts/test-model-token-promotion.py` checks local-day boundaries across daylight-saving transitions. Operator steps: [model-token-promotions.md](../operations/model-token-promotions.md).

## Account-scoped first-content SLA

`coordinator/tests/api/first_content_accounts_test.go` covers exact account/email selection, unrelated service accounts, header spoofing, public-model override precedence, disabled clocks and identity-store failures. `coordinator/tests/api/inference/contracts/first_content_accounts_integration_test.go` runs streaming and non-streaming requests through chat, Responses, completions and messages past the old deadline with hard TTFT rejection enabled; exempt requests omit their wire budget and scheduler ceiling, while the configured OpenRouter email still times out. The existing deadline/queue/retry/provider-wire suites explicitly opt their fixture account into the SLA. `coordinator/tests/api/inference/media_resolve_test.go` (`TestResolveRemoteMediaPinnedSLAExemptionDoesNotRecompute`) verifies a pinned exemption cannot be recomputed during media fetch. Root `coordinator/tests/api/first_content_accounts_test.go` retains only the environment-configuration test (`TestFirstContentSLAAccountsEnvironment`).

### Adversarial numeric parsing

`coordinator/tests/api/inference/request/tool_constraints_test.go`
(`TestConstrainedExactNonnegativeIntBoundsAdversarialLiterals`) checks exact
integer results and rejects fractional, negative, huge-exponent and multi-megabyte
inputs. The original 250 ms per-call budget remains enforced by normal tests
and a separate uninstrumented step in the Coordinator Tests CI job. Covered
runs use a five-second catastrophic-stall ceiling to allow for race and
atomic-coverage overhead. The benchmark below supplements that enforced CI gate;
it does not replace it. Neither wall-clock budget proves linear complexity.
No production parser limit or acceptance rule changes.

Run the enforced performance gate with
`go test -race=false -cover=false ./coordinator/tests/api/inference/request -run '^TestConstrainedExactNonnegativeIntBoundsAdversarialLiterals$' -count=1`.
The following full CI suite still runs with race detection and atomic coverage.

Measure size scaling separately with
`coordinator/tests/api/inference/request/tool_constraint_numbers_bench_test.go`
(`BenchmarkConstrainedExactNonnegativeIntAdversarialLiterals`):

```sh
go test ./coordinator/tests/api/inference/request -run '^$' \
  -bench '^BenchmarkConstrainedExactNonnegativeIntAdversarialLiterals$' -benchmem
```

Run this benchmark without race or coverage instrumentation. Fixtures are built
outside the timed loop; bytes/second and allocations are reported for digit and
fractional literals from 1,000 to 4,000,000 digits. Compare growth across sizes
and revisions on the same machine; shared-runner wall time is not a complexity
measurement.

### Routing plan equivalence

`coordinator/tests/registry/dispatch_plan_test.go`
(`TestReserveProviderWithPlanPrimarySelectionUnchanged`) compares provider
selection and routing decisions with and without retained alternatives. It
uses a controlled clock and different fresh evidence ages, then normalizes
wall-clock telemetry, including known capacity/performance/transport evidence ages on
the decision and candidate summaries; unknown-age sentinels, selection, forecast values and reservations
remain subject to exact comparison. Repeat the focused test with
`go test ./coordinator/tests/registry -run '^TestReserveProviderWithPlanPrimarySelectionUnchanged$' -count=500`
from the repository root to check for timing-dependent comparison failures.

### Replacement and reconnect coverage

`PlannedProviderDisconnectTests` exercises late-APNs and inventory reconnects
against a mock WebSocket coordinator while accepted work is held open.
`StandaloneLifecycleControlTests` holds a local response across a mailbox drain.
`LifecycleRecoveryRollbackTests` checks failures before and after command publication;
`ProcessLifecycleTests` verifies that lock acquisition cannot kill a live PID owner.
`TestRestartStatusReportsOwnerAuthorizationWithoutPublicGrant` checks explicit
owner authorization while retaining runtime/security denials.

## Experimental Autopilot integration

Autopilot testbed suites explicitly set `ObserveOnly=false` for isolated live
execution and start their controller before KV-backend verification
(`e2e/testbed/suite.go`, `Suite.Start`). This is not the production default.
That verification observes Autopilot-created slots and keeps the same strict
backend check; it does not send a competing legacy `load_model` to an enrolled
provider. This also covers CI lanes with `DARKBLOOM_TESTBED_EXPECT_KV_BACKEND` set.

`e2e/autopilot_test.go` (`TestIntegration_AutopilotCachedBootstrapAndPause`)
starts an isolated PostgreSQL coordinator and a real local Swift provider with
explicit consent in its temporary test config. It verifies a durable intent,
actual cached-model load, terminal heartbeat, inference, and operator pause.
It never enrolls the operator's production provider. The normal testbed model
must already be downloaded and the provider must have its source-matched Metal
library. Run:

```bash
go test ./e2e -run TestIntegration_AutopilotCachedBootstrapAndPause -count=1 -timeout 10m
```

The request-shape, selected-model, revision/session, ledger-failure and donor-floor
regressions also run in the coordinator/provider unit and race suites. Real
production improvement remains a separate measured rollout result.

## Advisory threat-model review checks

The conditional gate uses a separate organization-membership read token.
`python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-bedrock.py` checks active member identity,
outsiders, bots, pending membership, repeat lookups and the independent human
review path. The budget suite checks that local validator reasons remain visible
without exposing raw provider output. See [review configuration](threat-model-review.md).

The threat-review preflight checks the configured OpenRouter budget mode and
remaining normal-attempt capacity as well as writer access and funding. Offline
budget regressions cover migration without resetting charges, daily caps,
unknown reservations and exhausted-pilot detection; see
[review configuration](threat-model-review.md#openrouter-budget-behavior-and-recovery).

Run `python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-model-review.py` for the review input,
OpenRouter response validation, credential isolation, pagination, stale-head and
comment lifecycle tests. The suite opens a temporary loopback HTTP server and
uses no external service or real key. Also run
`python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-full-scan.py` for full-source retrieval,
batching beyond the former cutoffs, cross-file review, and explicit incomplete
coverage. Run `python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-ensemble.py` for independent
reviewer coverage, disagreement, attribution, partial failures and deadline
retention. Run `python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-budget.py` for atomic spending
reservations over local HTTP, cache invalidation, selective escalation, cost
reconciliation, partial-result persistence, split-diff citations on both sides,
Sol 6.1 request parameters, compact delivery of oversized reports, and a
zero-spend activation preflight covering signed storage, provider funding, and
redaction of private funding details from public output. Release
Integrity runs all four suites in normal CI, without real provider calls.
Model findings and live API failures remain non-blocking in the separate
[advisory review workflow](threat-model-review.md).

### macOS E2E Postgres setup

The integration and benchmark jobs run `scripts/setup-macos-homebrew.sh`
before they install `postgresql@16` and get its binary path with
`brew --prefix`. The script finds Homebrew or installs it from a pinned,
checksum-verified installer. If Homebrew is still missing, the step fails
before E2E tests run. See `.github/workflows/integration.yml` and
`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`.
`./scripts/test-setup-macos-homebrew.sh` tests the path where `brew` is
already installed. It uses a fake `brew` in a temporary directory, makes no
download, and runs in the "Release Integrity" CI job.

### Retained unsigned release recovery checks

`python3 scripts/test-provider-release-resume.py` covers signed-tag/source/run
identity, failed or missing prerequisite jobs, expired/ambiguous artifacts,
signed-artifact refusal, transport checksums/layout and the signing job's
normal/recovery success guard. Publication tests bind original build source and
current signing provenance separately and require a moved tag to fail before
registration. These offline checks do not grant App Attest qualification or
prove successful Apple signing/notarization.

## Stripe migration maintenance

Build the audit/repair binary with `go build -o /tmp/payout-audit ./coordinator/cmd/payout-audit`.
It uses the configured database without running migrations and defaults to read-only
bounded output. Applying a refund requires an exact withdrawal ID, expected amount
and an operator-verified Stripe request. See [the cutover runbook](../operations/stripe-migration.md).

Exercise the API, funding and settlement contracts with
`go test ./coordinator/tests/api/... ./coordinator/tests/billing/... ./coordinator/tests/store/... ./coordinator/tests/cmd/payout-audit`.
Set `DATABASE_URL` to a disposable local PostgreSQL database to run transaction,
concurrency and rollback coverage. Never point tests at production. Console
migration coverage runs with `npm test` in `console-ui`.

## Telemetry archive validation

In `scripts/telemetry_archive`, run `uv run ruff check src tests`, `uv run ruff format --check src tests`, and `uv run pytest -q`. Set `TEST_ARCHIVE_DATABASE_URL` only to a disposable local database named `archive_test` for PostgreSQL restoration, snapshot-isolation, and nested-outcome tests. Accounting tests cover signed micro-USD values, sums beyond INT64, backdated timestamps, sparse IDs, late commits, destination separation, and exact restoration of all four accounting tables. The tests reject remote databases. Production copy/BigQuery verification is a separate gate in [telemetry history](../operations/telemetry-history.md) and [accounting history](../operations/accounting-history.md).

Analytics preview tests reject mixed datasets, injected catalog identifiers,
missing coverage, unbounded series and excessive scan budgets. Optional
SELECT-only BigQuery semantics tests use synthetic CTE fixtures, creating no
cloud datasets or tables: set `TEST_ARCHIVE_BIGQUERY_PROJECT` explicitly and
run `uv run pytest -q tests/test_analytics_bigquery.py`. They exercise provider
versus reward-only cohorts, anonymous network earnings, signed corrections,
base-reward exclusion from tokens/jobs, ties/limits, empty windows, exact time
boundaries and sums beyond INT64. CI skips these credentialed tests; their live
results must be recorded separately from the local suite.

Backfill regressions cover explicit recapture generations, legacy plan identity,
large sharded completion catalogs and deadline enforcement during saved-checkpoint
replay. Publication tests verify reused catalog schema and content, not only row
counts. Async-query tests use real BigQuery SDK value objects with local transport
fixtures to check dry-run rejection, pinned sources, idempotent named submission,
bounded polling/pagination, exact decimal results and owned cancellation; they do
not establish live BigQuery or IAM correctness. Run the complete locked suite
with `uv run --locked pytest -q` after `uv sync --locked`.

Archived snapshot validation and no-scan HTTP tests live in `coordinator/tests/analyticssnapshot` and `coordinator/tests/api/reporting/analytics_snapshot_test.go`; run `go test -race ./coordinator/tests/analyticssnapshot ./coordinator/tests/api/reporting ./coordinator/tests/api`. The snapshot tests exercise the exported decoder and cache APIs; HTTP tests exercise the reporting owner and retain the separate database-backed core stats refresh. Python `test_snapshot_sync.py` tests generation/hash/scope validation and atomic file replacement. See [snapshot operations](../operations/analytics-snapshots.md).

Leaderboard cache tests cover concurrent callers with different limits and aliases sharing one top-200 query, and failed queries retaining only their cooldown. Store tests cover closed pools and scan overflow after a valid first row returning an error with no partial ranking; the latter uses the isolated PostgreSQL test database.

## Account erasure regressions

`coordinator/tests/internal/erasurefixture/account.go` seeds an account's
credentials, provider, balances and Stripe session for mirrored store tests.
`coordinator/tests/store/contracts/erasure_late_writes_test.go` checks late
external results, location suppression without lost accounting and refused
credit replay. PostgreSQL tests use real row/advisory-lock barriers for
withdrawal admission and simultaneous shared-owner scrubs; the composed HTTP
Checkout regression pauses a local fake Stripe server across erasure.
`coordinator/tests/internal/erasurefixture/commit.go` cancels the caller through
pgx tracing after PostgreSQL confirms `COMMIT`. Store regressions cover plan
creation/replacement, confirmation, cancellation and scrubbing, plus rollback
when a returned summary cannot be decoded. Composed API regressions verify
provider disconnects and auth/usage cache cleanup. The account API contract
package uses `testdb.Main` to isolate this PostgreSQL coverage in a disposable
database, just like the store suites.
The marker fixture in `coordinator/tests/store/postgres/erasure_marker_test.go`
seeds every personal-data rule, including frozen legacy MDM cohort and saved
hardware interest, and verifies another account's markers survive.

The route batching tracer in
`coordinator/tests/store/postgres/route_telemetry_batch_test.go` distinguishes
bulk inserts from the account-erasure lock and ownership lookup. It requires
one insert, one lock and one lookup per chunk, with at most two transaction
boundary statements; duplicates still split into ordered chunks. Outcome
updates retain their single pipelined batch. The memory marker fixture also
freezes real MDM eligibility and stores hardware-interest markers before
scrubbing, so every memory-backed personal-data rule has observed coverage.

The scanner regressions also verify numbered source reconstruction, annotation
capacity, original citation coordinates, and that final-reviewer uncertainty cannot
grant conditional merge clearance.
