# Build

> Last updated: 2026-10-10

Stack maintenance uses Python 3, Git, authenticated `gh`, and a configured commit
signer; it requires no product build. Follow [Maintain a pull-request stack](pull-requests.md)
for `scripts/restack-after-squash.py` checks, signed ancestry updates, and
post-push verification. Branch updates still require the affected CI gates.

The provider test runner isolates daemon-state and loaded-model snapshots in a
temporary directory for each run. Unit-test providers must not overwrite the
operator's live status or recovery evidence (`scripts/run-provider-tests.sh`).

The Autopilot E2E harness creates canonical inventory records and persists live
desired mode only for its running, authenticated, suite-owned provider handles
before starting control (`e2e/testbed/autopilot_cohort.go`,
`bindAutopilotFixtureMachines`). It uses the same isolated test store as the
coordinator, not an environment allowlist or arbitrary UUID insertion.
These isolated trusted inputs replace Apple attestation only in the testbed;
they do not disable the production cohort gate or the real provider's live-lease
acknowledgement. See [cohort validation](test.md#autopilot-machine-cohorts).

SSD epoch lookup regressions use the current provider test product and its
normal source-matched resources. Filesystem permission cases require a non-root
test user; they change permissions only on each fixture's temporary model root.
The connected retirement snapshot oracle has an ordinary Go test and does not
require a model download or running provider.

CI and Integration Tests cancel an older run only when a newer revision of the
same pull request starts in that workflow. Concurrency groups include the
workflow and event names; non-PR runs use a unique run ID, so default-branch pushes
remain independent. Provider unit, SDK, parity and integration jobs remain
parallel, without a shared-build dependency between workflows.

Integration Tests reuse their own compatible Swift debug and Rust build caches
through `scripts/provider-ci-cache.py` (`keys --lane integration`). The restore
prefix binds the lane, toolchain, SDK, OS, checkout path, dependency pins and build
recipe; the exact key also binds the source commit. Restored source timestamps
are checked by content, cached runtime resources are discarded, and Swift and
sidecar build commands still execute. Metal uses an exact source/toolchain key
shared with compatible provider lanes, followed by the existing source-matched
validation and staging. Cache misses build normally; caches never skip E2E tests
or enter the separate release-build namespace. Compare cache transfer plus build
time and whole-job runtime on real runners before claiming a saving.
Homebrew and `zstd` are installed before any integration cache restore, including
Go's cache. Restore and save must use the same compression format, which is part
of the Actions cache version; installing it between those steps produces misses
even when the visible cache key matches.
For offline validation of integration cache wiring and E2E commands with or
without coverage instrumentation, run the [workflow regression tests](test.md#component-ci-routing).
The test-bundle staging helper uses APFS-capable clone copies on Darwin and ordinary
copies on other platforms, so its offline Linux tests exercise the same atomic
copy, byte-comparison and rename path (`scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh`).

Pull-request CI selects expensive component jobs through
`scripts/ci-component-paths.py`, called by `.github/workflows/component-changes.yml`.
The detector checks out full history without persisted credentials and compares
the PR head with its merge base against the event's base SHA. It uses a local,
NUL-delimited Git diff, including both sides of renames and deleted paths, not
the truncated GitHub changed-files API. Docs and `AGENTS.md` changes alone do
not build Swift, Go, Rust or the console, or schedule E2E integration/benchmarks.
Release Integrity and Docs Lint remain unconditional. Default-branch pushes
retain full coverage; a new-branch push or manual invocation selects all lanes.
Other pushes compare the event's before/after SHAs. Missing revisions fail
detection rather than producing skip outputs.

Component source, pinned SDK submodules, build actions and explicitly selected
tooling activate their consumers. Protocol fixtures, prompt-contract producers,
Rust sidecar dependencies and Go module pins also activate provider parity.
Each CI workflow change exercises that workflow's lanes; changes to the shared
detector exercise all callers. The existing push-only Swift cache job is unchanged.
The separate release preparation workflow retains its existing triggers.

Registry performance comparisons use the same pinned Go toolchain for both
revisions. Build each `coordinator/tests/registry` test binary with `go test -c`
before timing, then run the prebuilt binaries without concurrent compilation.
The [reservation benchmark procedure](test.md#reservation-storage-and-scan-benchmarks)
describes fixtures, interleaving and the distinction between local routing cost
and production latency.

How to build every component of Darkbloom from a fresh clone: the Go
coordinator, the Rust prompt-contract sidecar, the Swift provider CLI (with its
source-matched `mlx.metallib`), and the console and marketing Next.js UIs.
`make build` builds those components; the admin UI is built separately below.

The SDK test product copies its `MiMoOpenRouter` media fixture directory as a
test-only resource (`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Package.swift`). Those files are not
provider product resources. Build SDK tests separately from provider tests
when validating the media working-set change; see [test gates](test.md).

The macOS integration and benchmark workflows run
`scripts/setup-macos-homebrew.sh` before they install `postgresql@16`. The
script uses `brew` if it is on `PATH`, at `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` or at
`/usr/local/bin/brew`. If it finds no `brew`, it downloads the official
Homebrew installer from a pinned commit, checks its SHA-256, and runs it with
`NONINTERACTIVE=1`. In both cases it writes the `brew shellenv` values to
`$GITHUB_ENV` and `$GITHUB_PATH` for later steps. The workflows do not use the
`Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew` action, because the organization Actions
policy does not allow it. To move the installer pin, change the commit and the
SHA-256 in the script together.

macOS jobs that download artifacts, verify source signatures through the
GitHub API, or post benchmark results run `scripts/install-macos-github-cli.sh`
first. It installs the pinned official Apple Silicon CLI archive into a fresh
runner-temporary directory, verifies its SHA-256 before extraction, and exports
its binary path. It does not depend on Homebrew or the runner's preinstalled CLI.
The signing job also checks the system signing/archive tools and Xcode's
`notarytool`/`stapler` before handling the artifact. A tooling-only recovery can
reuse an already qualified unsigned build through the
[retained unsigned recovery procedure](../operations/provider-release.md#resume-signing-from-a-retained-unsigned-build).

Coordinator CI builds the adversarial-number test once without instrumentation
for its enforced performance budget, then builds the full suite with race
detection and atomic coverage. See [numeric parsing tests](test.md#adversarial-numeric-parsing)
for the separate commands and their timing limits.

The coordinator executable still builds from `coordinator/cmd/coordinator`.
Its command entrypoint validates configuration and delegates service assembly
to `coordinator/app`. Memory and PostgreSQL constructors now live in
`coordinator/store/memory` and `coordinator/store/postgres`; root `store` keeps
contracts and the read-through decorator. The application selects and wraps the
backend before binding the registry and HTTP domain owners. See the
[owner map](navigation.md) before changing an import or moving a fixture.

Coordinator Go tests live in `coordinator/tests/`, mirroring the production
owners. `go build ./coordinator/...` builds production code and ordinary
`go test ./coordinator/...` discovers the mirrored suites. `make coordinator-test`
adds checked shard discovery; coverage explicitly instruments the imported
production packages, excluding all test helpers. See the
[test-boundary map](test.md#2-coordinator-go) for focused commands.
The Autopilot reward worker and migration use the ordinary coordinator build;
the saved-consent wire mirror requires rebuilding the Swift provider too.
Use [reward test selectors](test.md#autopilot-rewards) for both backends, HTTP,
capture and wire coverage. Building does not enable payments, fund the pool,
publish the provider or activate a live cohort.
The account API contract suite uses the same `testdb.Main` database isolation
as store tests for [committed-erasure cleanup checks](test.md#account-erasure-regressions).
Routing snapshot-age regressions run against the ordinary coordinator build;
the [test guide](test.md#2-coordinator-go) includes a race-enabled repetition
command using the existing reservation-preparation fixture.

Registry-ID support changes Swift provider policy and Rust prompt normalization
together. Build the paired coordinator/sidecar/provider candidate; the v6
prompt contract cannot reuse a v5 cache identity. The follow-up retains the
merged native SDK pin and does not require new model weights. See
[prompt parity](test.md#9-prompt-contract-parity-fixtures-and-vectors) for the validation procedure.

Docs Lint needs Git history to validate moved source links in frozen records;
its checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs` job).
Freshness stamps contain only dates. The checker recovers legacy verification
commits from document history, or the particular link's introduction commit for
new date-only records; it never selects a commit by date. A format-only migration
uses `scripts/docs-stamp.sh --from-git` to preserve existing dates and evidence.
The job also initializes the exact pinned `libs/mlx-swift-lm` submodule so
model-support documentation links are checked against real SDK files.

The MiMo Rust parser/planner and provider prompt regressions require public
metadata, not model weights. The sidecar, provider-unit and prompt-parity jobs run
`scripts/prepare-mimo-prompt-fixtures.py`; follow the
[pinned fixture procedure](mimo-prompt-fixtures.md) for local runs. Missing
inputs fail rather than silently skipping assertions.

The prompt-parity lane also runs `scripts/verify-nemotron-prompt-parity.sh`
after the provider test product has been built. The existing Go artifact
provisioner fetches only hash-verified prompt metadata from the committed
Nemotron manifest; the gate uses no model weights or GPU generation. See the
[parity test procedure](test.md#9-prompt-contract-parity-fixtures-and-vectors).

Provider CI also runs `scripts/prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py` offline. It
writes a deterministic, bounded synthetic BF16 target/vision/audio-patch/three-head
inventory, not the selected model or its audio codec. Routine metadata tests use
the symmetric 128-context fixture; the separate complete-prefix process uses
`--asymmetric` for K64/V128 and 1,024-context geometry. No Python MLX installation,
native evaluation, model download, private corpus or verification receipt is
needed to provision these files. See [MiMo provider CI tests](test.md#mimo-provider-ci-fixtures)
for environment bindings and the isolated native selections.
The provider-unit job retains all three native selections after its general
suite. Each selection requires the successful shared build/Metal preparation
and synthetic fixtures, and still runs if an earlier test fails.
The SDK qualification lane in the shared release-build action provisions the
same routine fixtures before its watchdog-driven provider tests. Release-only
builds do not provision test fixtures or enable native qualification.

`scripts/prepare-mimo-audio-fixtures.py` separately downloads hash-pinned public
metadata, the genuine 1.87 GB MiMo input codec, and the public OpenRouter AAC video fixture. It feeds
`prepare-mimo-provider-fixtures.py --audio-source` to build a small synthetic
target with the selected tokenizer/audio IDs. The codec is never synthesized or
relabelled, and normal native loading verifies it again. CI and SDK release
qualification cache those immutable inputs and run an isolated authenticated
PCM8 and AAC-video inference gate. This proves the route with a small target, not the
full model's output quality or production peak memory.

Production prompt parity compares the generated corpus byte-for-byte with its
checked-in fixture, including its EOF format with no extra newline.

Changes to native loading estimates and retirement require a rebuilt provider
test product, not only a new CLI. Bind both products and the SDK/metallib to the
same checkout before running the [memory and lifecycle gates](test.md).
See [historical source references](historical-references.md) for local setup.

Native CI test isolation reuses these built test products and their staged
metallib, including the MiMo memory-admission heartbeat and pending-request gates.
The provider media gate and nested SDK native-media deadline suite also reuse
these products to check guarded learning and target-only rate admission.
Their shared test wrapper uses bounded temporary filenames independently of
filter length; selecting more cases does not require rebuilding the products.
Those gates use bounded synthetic weights and production memory reserves; their
2 GiB logical contiguous grants do not preallocate 2 GiB of KV storage. See the
[memory regression procedure](test.md) for the scope of this evidence.

Other native CI test isolation also reuses the built test products and staged
metallib; it does not rebuild or download a model. Follow the
[provider test procedure](test.md) to run GPU-global assertions in separate
processes with the exclusive opt-in scoped to the named test.

The exact-cache E2E fixture uses the built provider and pinned Gemma checkpoint
with an explicit SSD-cache opt-in. Its ephemeral storage setting alone does not
enable caching; see the [E2E prerequisites](test.md#prerequisites).

The [Bonsai performance qualification](test.md#bonsai-performance-qualification)
uses a separate optimized test build with `-enable-testing` and `-DDEBUG` for
test-only ownership/scheduler seams. Do not add these switches to the ordinary
production build or substitute its benchmark archive with a test binary.

Model publishing can pass `HUGGING_FACE_ARTIFACT_JSON` through
`scripts/publish-model.sh` to registration. See the
[model publishing procedure](../operations/model-migration.md).

The admin, smoke and fleet helpers use the tools pinned here. Their local fixture
checks are covered by [script validation](test.md#6-scripts-and-release-integrity);
the [dev operations runbook](../operations/dev-environment.md) covers invocation.

Profiler wire changes require both coordinator and provider builds; the shared
Go/Swift fixture and focused checks are described in [test.md](test.md) and
[prediction telemetry](../reference/prediction-decision-telemetry.md).

The `ProviderAppAttest` Swift target uses public DeviceCheck/Security APIs. Its [shadow packaging and live-validation requirements](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#packaging-and-live-acceptance) are separate from a successful local compile.

After changing provider authorization summaries, rebuild the provider test
product before running the [authorization guidance tests](test.md#provider-authorization-guidance).
They exercise shared production decisions without invoking status/doctor's
host probes or native Apple operations; signed-release qualification remains
separate.

The provider email operator command builds separately with
`go build -o /tmp/provider-emails ./coordinator/cmd/provider-emails`. It is not
part of the coordinator server process. See the [provider email runbook](../operations/provider-emails.md).

Provider signing, R2 staging and publication run in separate jobs in `.github/workflows/release-swift.yml`. `scripts/provider-release-publication.py` stages the final signed bundle under an immutable digest path, retains metadata, and gates publication on coordinator qualification. A staging or publication retry downloads and reuses the original signed artifact and does not rerun compilation or notarization. `scripts/provider_release_github.py` resumes draft/upload state, verifies asset hashes before publishing and never replaces completed mismatched bytes. See [build qualification](../operations/app-attest-build-qualification.md).

The revision publisher accepts optional per-version HF repo, commit and path-prefix flags. It runs the SwiftPM `darkbloom-publish` executable to hash
artifacts. It also needs Python 3 and the AWS CLI; use the existing pinned tools.
The [revision runbook](../operations/model-revisions.md) describes its invocation.

## Bedrock review workflow

The conditional gate uses a separate organization-membership read token.
`python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-bedrock.py` checks active member identity,
outsiders, bots, pending membership, repeat lookups and the independent human
review path. The budget suite checks that local validator reasons remain visible
without exposing raw provider output. See [review configuration](threat-model-review.md).

The optional Bedrock reviewer installs hash-locked dependencies from
`.github/scripts/requirements-bedrock.txt` in its trusted workflow.
Review, preflight and smoke checkouts fetch only the trusted scanner scripts and
threat definitions, avoiding unrelated repository blobs before verification.
`python3 .github/scripts/test-threat-bedrock.py` covers explicit provider fallback
and conditional merge clearance without cloud calls. Live validation and activation
are separate: see [the rollout runbook](../operations/threat-review-rollout.md).

The threat-review preflight checks the configured OpenRouter budget mode and
remaining normal-attempt capacity as well as writer access and funding. Offline
budget regressions cover migration without resetting charges, daily caps,
unknown reservations and exhausted-pilot detection; see
[review configuration](threat-model-review.md#openrouter-budget-behavior-and-recovery).

## Standalone SSD accounting check

`bash scripts/test-ssd-write-budget.sh` compiles only the production
`SSDWriteBudget.swift` and `SSDWriteRateLimiter.swift` sources, then links their
Swift Testing suites with Xcode's testing framework. It needs no MLX submodule
build or GPU work and removes its temporary build output on exit. See the
[SSD endurance tests](test.md#ssd-write-endurance) for scope and limitations.

## Nightly Linear workflow

The [nightly Linear package](../../automations/nightly-linear/README.md) needs
Git, Python 3, local Codex desktop, and the teammate's own Linear connection.
The [one-time setup prompt](../../automations/nightly-linear/teammate-prompt.md)
creates a dedicated managed clone and links its two skills into the user's skill
directory. Personal configuration and recovery state stay outside that clone.
Claude Code and Pi supply saved work histories; they need no plugin installation.

Each trigger runs `automations/nightly-linear/refresh.py` (`refresh`) to fetch
one revision of the shared skills and playbook before any Linear updates.
The [test procedure](test.md#nightly-linear-package) covers the updater's failure
and preservation guarantees. The package's CI workflow runs these offline tests;
it does not schedule anyone's nightly task or require Linear credentials.

## SDK 27 release builds and caches

All checked-in `d-inference` workflow jobs use Blacksmith runners. macOS build,
unit/SDK/parity, integration, benchmark, cache, signing and validation jobs pin
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-27` (M4, 12 vCPU, 48 GB); the signed-artifact older-OS
smoke pins `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`. Coordinator Tests uses
`blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404`; other Linux jobs retain
`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`. The macOS 27 image is currently a public beta;
see [Blacksmith's runner catalog](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-runners/overview).
This migration is limited to this repository; SDK repository workflows are separate.

`prepare-provider-release-toolchain.sh` resolves the image-selected Xcode via
`xcode-select`/`xcrun` after checkout and refuses any SDK other than 27.0 or Apple
Swift other than 6.4. Its repository wrapper forces native SwiftPM and the same
SDK for build/test invocations. CI fingerprints the selected compiler, SDK and
wrapper so it cannot reuse incompatible prior-image products. Pinned Python
3.12.10, checksum-verified Rustup 1.28.2/Rust 1.88.0 (where needed), and CMake
3.31.12 supply tools missing from the image. Metal caches include the CMake
recipe/identity; changing generators cannot reuse a stale metallib.

GitHub Actions remains the orchestrator and artifact store. Protected signing
and publication jobs retain their existing approvals, credential scopes and
same-run artifact checks. Existing runs keep the workflow from their source
commit: merging runner changes does not move an already-started release.


Serving performance work changes the pinned CBv2 library as well as the
provider. Initialize the recorded submodules before building, and retain
source-matched Metal libraries for benchmarks. The
[profile qualification procedure](serving-performance-qualification.md)
records the exact model/runtime/backend/hardware identity; a successful build
alone does not qualify a wider serving limit. Use
`python3 scripts/build-serving-qualification.py --output /tmp/qualification-build`
after committing the candidate. This cleans prior products, selects the dedicated
`ServingQualificationTests` target with release optimization and `-enable-testing`,
stages its source-matched Metal library, and runs the actual executable-identity
test. The ordinary package graph still includes all unit tests. Pass the generated
`build-receipt.json` to `scripts/run-serving-qualification.py --build-receipt`;
the runner verifies the source, binary and metallib binding before collecting
model/runtime evidence. Neither command installs a provider. Release Integrity
CI runs the offline `scripts/serving_performance/` tests without building Swift
or downloading weights; hardware qualification still requires the managed build.
Archived raw-corpus replay is opt-in; see the
[local evidence checks](serving-performance-qualification.md#verify-local-evidence).

The release pipeline runs optimized products and SDK qualification on separate
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-27` runners. Both call `.github/actions/provider-release-build/action.yml`;
only the optimized lane transfers an unsigned app and its file inventory to
signing. All binaries, SwiftPM resource bundles and the source-matched Metal
library travel together. Signing verifies the same-run artifact's source commit,
version, inventory and entitlements before importing its certificate.

`.github/workflows/provider-release-cache.yml` runs the same two lanes after
relevant `master` changes. Release tags can restore those default-branch caches;
they cannot reuse another tag's cache. Release-plumbing PRs run these lanes with
PR-scoped caches and no signing or publishing secrets. Changes to
`BoundedSingleConsumerPipeline.swift` or its tests also run both lanes to catch
shutdown lifetime regressions with the release compiler. Two concurrent SDK 27
runners are needed for the parallel wall-time benefit; a smaller runner quota
queues the jobs without changing their gates.

`scripts/provider-release-cache.py` (`keys`) separates optimized and qualification
Swift caches by selected compiler/SDK identity, machine architecture, absolute
checkout/toolchain paths, dependencies and build recipe. A source commit names an
immutable generation; restore prefixes stay inside that compatibility boundary.
The qualification lane separately caches Rust 1.88.0 dependencies and target
objects. It always cleans and recompiles the local `promptsidecar` package while
retaining third-party objects: independently restored Swift and Rust caches must
not combine source timestamps with a different generation of local Rust outputs.
The Metal helper retains its exact source/toolchain contract.
`scripts/prepare-metal-toolchain.py` requires the selected Xcode's Metal compiler
to execute successfully. A successful component download alone is insufficient:
it clears stale lookup state, waits a bounded interval for registration, and uses
Apple's explicit component export/import path if registration remains incomplete.
It never switches to an older Xcode or silently accepts an unavailable compiler.

The helper's `snapshot-mtimes` and `restore-mtimes` commands retain timestamps for
tracked files whose contents are unchanged. Changed/new files retain their fresh
timestamps and rebuild. Cached metadata never restores source contents or touches
untracked files, links, Git metadata or paths outside the checkout. These commands
make compilation incremental; every restored build still runs its build and
qualification commands. Only unsigned build directories are cached, never signing
keys or notarized bundles.

See the [release cache procedure](../operations/provider-release.md#prepare-and-check-release-caches)
for first-run costs and rerun behavior.

## Parallel Provider CI Builds

When provider dependencies change, the CI workflow runs provider tests, nested SDK correctness gates, and
production prompt parity as three independent macOS jobs. Each job owns a
separate checkout, build directory, GPU, and unified-memory allocator. No job
waits for another job's test outcome. The nested SDK job still builds all of its
test products; a provider test build does not compile a dependency's tests.
The existing required `Provider Tests` check is a small aggregate gate with
[verified intentional-skip handling](test.md#component-ci-routing). Selected
unit, SDK, and parity lanes must all succeed; unexpected skips or cancellation
fail. It does not serialize their work or change branch-protection settings.

`.github/actions/provider-ci-build/action.yml` builds each lane using
`scripts/provider-ci-cache.py` (`keys`). Provider debug tests, SDK debug tests,
and Swift/Rust parity have separate cache prefixes bound to the actual compiler,
SDK, architecture, checkout path, recursive dependency pins, and CI build recipe.
Each source commit names a generation. Content-verified timestamp restoration
reuses only unchanged tracked source files; changed files retain fresh timestamps.
Every cache hit still runs the full build and runtime-resource staging commands.

The source-matched Metal cache is separate and shared only across compatible
lanes. Its key binds the native MLX pin, Xcode/SDK identity, the independently
downloaded Metal compiler version and bytes, helper contract, and
deployment target. Restored runtime bundles and metallibs are discarded before
building; `scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh` invokes the validating source builder
and stages the library beside the actual test runner and inside its resource
bundle. A cache hit is not permission to skip these checks.

Successful build jobs save their debug objects before assertions run, so an
unrelated test failure does not force a complete rebuild on the next attempt.
The parity job cleans local Rust products and saves its Cargo cache only after
the real tokenizer/vector/load-proof script succeeds. The push-only release
cache job no longer duplicates the SDK debug-test build. These caches contain
unsigned build products, not release artifacts or signing material.

Parallel speedup requires capacity for three concurrent macOS runners. More
jobs queued behind a provider quota do not shorten the critical path. See
[provider CI tests](test.md#parallel-provider-ci) for execution gates and validation.

## Prerequisites

- Start commands from the repository root. Component examples that use
  `(cd path && command)` run in a subshell and preserve your current directory.

- **Toolchain via [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/).** Every version is pinned in
  [`mise.toml`](../../mise.toml); `mise install` installs them all.

  | Tool | Pin | Used by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `go` | `1.26.8` | coordinator, e2e (matches the container builder and satisfies the `1.26.0` minimum in [`go.mod`](../../go.mod)) |
  | `rust` | `1.88.0` | `coordinator/promptsidecar` (matches `rust-version = "1.88"` in `coordinator/promptsidecar/Cargo.toml` and the `rust:1.88.0-alpine` builder in `coordinator/Dockerfile`) |
  | `node` | `22` | `console-ui`, `admin-ui` |
  | `swift` | `6.3` | `provider-swift` (the local `libs/mlx-swift` package declares `swift-tools-version: 6.3`; `provider-swift/Package.swift` itself is `6.1`) |
  | `python` | `3.12` | `scripts/*.py`, benchmark wrapper tests |
  | `jq`, `gh`, `awscli`, `gcloud` | `latest` | scripts, release and deploy tooling |

- **macOS on Apple Silicon** for anything under `provider-swift/` (MLX + Metal).
  The coordinator, sidecar, e2e harness, and UIs build on macOS or Linux.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools + `cmake`** (`brew install cmake`) — the metallib
  helper compiles MLX's Metal kernels with cmake.
- **Git submodules** checked out: `libs/mlx-swift`, `libs/mlx-swift-lm`,
  `libs/mlx` (`git clone --recurse-submodules …` or
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`). `provider-swift/Package.swift`
  depends on `../libs/mlx-swift` and `../libs/mlx-swift-lm` by local path.
- **Docker** only for the coordinator container image (step 9).

### Pinned MLX dependencies

The provider consumes the local packages through immutable Git submodule pins:

| Package | Merged revision | Included update |
|---|---|---|
| `libs/mlx` | `cb77239be31b1df7f5db895226af55c39fc4f093` | `gather_mm` / `gather_qmm` row-tile backport |
| `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx` | `cb77239be31b1df7f5db895226af55c39fc4f093` | Same merged MLX source used by Cmlx and the provider metallib |
| `libs/mlx-swift` | `6923a80f624f5c91fbf456efe4e00e9698a72961` | [PR #34](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift/pull/34): merged nested MLX row-tile backport and regenerated kernel sources; retains [PR #28](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift/pull/28) exact constant reuse for eligible Bonsai packed projections |
| `libs/mlx-swift-lm` | `3fd4944c3b3ee5cb45c5cbfac8805876332d3a29` | Includes [PR #289](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/289) bounded demanded checkpoint capture, retention and continuation, [PR #290](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/290) native cancellation retirement, and [PR #165](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/165) typical MTP acceptance |

Keep both local packages in the provider build. The SDK's standalone package
manifest pins Swift `0f4fe403bef6899e8a72882bc6d4036a7a62ae31`, not the provider's
current Swift gitlink; the nested-test
procedure in [test.md](test.md#4-provider-swift--unit-tests-with-a-source-matched-metallib) binds it to the recorded local
Swift gitlink. Keep `libs/mlx` and `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx` on the same
merged MLX commit for the `gather_mm` / `gather_qmm` row-tile backport. The Swift
pin includes kernel sources regenerated from that nested MLX revision, including
the signed integer floor-division corrections from [MLX PR #32](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx/pull/32)
in the generated binary-operations and CPU preamble sources.
Build `mlx.metallib` from the nested source with
`scripts/fetch-metallib.sh`; changing only the top-level MLX gitlink does not
change provider bytes.
Rebuild the consumer after changing pins; earlier full-model measurements are
evidence for their recorded dependency set, not a new benchmark of these pins.
The SDK's acceptance default remains exact; the provider's eligible sampled
target-prefix MTP requests default to typical acceptance, while greedy requests
remain exact. See [the serving policy](../architecture/inference.md#multi-token-prediction).
Neither that policy nor the newer native retirement and MLX kernels are
qualified by the original demanded-prefix full-model results. The
[dependency validation procedure](test.md#merged-sdk-pin-validation) separates
required tiny-fixture regressions from fresh full-model performance qualification.
The earlier SDK [PR #170](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/170)
pin `4101d4c1bfa6b3175e7f34393e8c235a75a7c1be` had production libraries and a
package manifest matching review head `b52335b839d80c8e6d4194ebbd8809d737cd8eb3`.
That historical comparison is not validation of the current SDK pin above.

### Native Flash-Next candidate

The Qwen 3.8 Next integration originally landed in
[SDK PR #149](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm/pull/149), commit
`729fa45c67a8b1cb26b1debeacf7f1d16ef3a21e`. That commit's complete Git tree is identical
to the approved review head `ae3ecdc835a895091f8929749fdb3e14383295a9`.
The current SDK gitlink above retains this support. Use the recorded gitlink,
not a floating branch or a private experiment.

Use the repository-owned [conversion tools](../../scripts/qwen38_conversion/README.md)
for the pinned official source. Metadata verification is distinct from full
payload hashing; conversion validates each source shard and writes a new
output/manifest while retaining the trained assistant and packed PLE table.
Inspect the tool's storage requirements before full hashing or conversion and
coordinate the model/GPU operator. Never create a missing mount path or reuse
an existing output directory. These commands do not publish an artifact.

Before describing the candidate as reproducible:

1. Record the selected source trees/patch digests and approved immutable core,
   C, Swift, SDK and provider pins. Inspect the composed SDK's
   `libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/qwen4/composition.md` for required source selection and
   excluded experiments.
2. Resolve CMake/package revisions and nested gitlinks in a fresh recursive
   private checkout. A machine-specific dependency symlink, local package
   override or unrecorded core patch does not close this gate. After each
   dependency merge, record the resulting approved commit, update its consumers
   and repeat affected checks; a review-head pin is not a final merged pin.
3. Build the provider with the source-matched metallib and required SwiftPM
   resources using the procedures below; record actual binary/library/resource
   identities. Source parsing alone is not a build or runtime test.
4. Complete the [candidate test matrix](test.md#native-flash-next-candidate)
   on that final artifact. Keep private draft staging, signing/release, model
   publication, catalog activation and deployment as distinct outcomes.

Current source and validation limits are in the
[candidate reference](../reference/qwen4-next-support.md#validation-status-and-next-gates).

SwiftPM may mark generated resource bundles hidden on macOS. The SDK's
`PagedAttentionResources.locate` must still discover their readable Metal
source inside its existing search roots. Do not clear filesystem flags or
disable paged eligibility to hide a failed preflight; keep sealed-app lookup
and conflicting-resource rejection intact. Stage and verify resources for
both the test host and any separately invoked CLI child.

Private prefill experiments, including packed-read lookahead and ordered NAX,
are excluded from this publication pin. Rebuild and rebind both the SDK tests and provider when its
gitlink changes; an earlier executable cannot qualify the new source merely
because the core metallib hash is unchanged.
Record the actual compiled NAX capability and precision posture; a hardware
product name does not prove which kernels or arithmetic were used.

The connected Go API matrix can reuse an independently hashed production
provider via `DARKBLOOM_PROVIDER_BINARY`; it does not build or substitute a
different native runtime. Record the Go coordinator/test source separately.
The [connected qualification instructions](test.md#native-flash-next-candidate)
bind coordinator traffic and native metrics to one authenticated unified
provider, with the Python runner and original oracles owned by this repository.

### Repository layout for builders

| Path | Toolchain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `go.mod` (repo root) | Go | Single module `github.com/eigeninference/d-inference`; contains `coordinator/...` and `e2e/...`. There is no `go.work` and no nested `go.mod`. |
| `coordinator/cmd/coordinator/` | Go | The coordinator binary (`main.go`). |
| `coordinator/promptsidecar/` | Rust | Crate `promptsidecar`, edition 2024, `Cargo.lock` committed; built with `--locked`. |
| `provider-swift/` | SwiftPM | Products: `darkbloom` (CLI), `darkbloom-enclave`, `darkbloom-fan-helper`, `darkbloom-publish`; libraries `ProviderCore`, `ProviderCoreFoundation`, `DarkbloomFan*`. Platform `macOS 14+`. |
| `console-ui/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | `npm`; tests with Vitest. |
| `admin-ui/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | `npm`; dev/start on port `4001`. |
| `landing/` | Next.js 16 / React 19 | Standalone npm app; `make landing` installs, lints, builds and runs route tests; dev/start on port `3008`. |
| `Makefile` | — | Every target below; `make help` lists them. |

Provider tests are grouped by subsystem inside their existing SwiftPM targets.
See [finding provider tests](test.md#finding-provider-tests) for the folder map;
`provider-swift/Package.swift` (`package`) retains recursive source discovery.
The [inference source map](../architecture/inference.md#code-map) locates engine,
memory, caching and request-processing code within the same `ProviderCore`
target; building these folders requires no separate products or commands.

## Steps

### 1. Install the toolchain and hooks

```bash
mise install                          # installs every pin in mise.toml
git submodule update --init --recursive
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enables pre-commit + pre-push (see "Git hooks")
```

`mise` activates the pinned versions per shell; on macOS the system Xcode
`swift` is also acceptable for `provider-swift`.

### 2. Build everything

```bash
make build      # coordinator-build prompt-sidecar-build provider-build ui-build
make all        # test + build (see test.md)
```

Continue with the per-component steps when you need one piece or want to
understand what `make` runs.

### 3. Coordinator (Go)

The owned two-host Go fixture embeds `e2e/testbed/provider_host.py`; rebuild
its test binary after helper or lifecycle changes. The CPU-only
`TestPrepareConnectedInputBindings` check uses the actual fixture input/report
types to prepare canonical catalog entries before a physical run. The helper waits within the existing
five-minute prelaunch bound for GPU ≤42°C and load1 ≤4, under the same control
lease used after launch. See the [test procedure](test.md#connected-coordinatorprovider-http-cache-gate).

Rebuild the E2E test executable after shared sidecar lifecycle or release-default
fixture changes. `startExactCacheSidecar` and the restart fixtures install the
API preload controller before starting it, matching coordinator startup. The
CPU-only API-readiness regression in the linked procedure uses a verified
Rust sidecar and immutable prompt artifacts; compiling it does not execute the
provider/API cache smoke or qualify model restoration.

CI checks formatting of tracked Go source while preserving frozen report
evidence bytes; see the [coordinator checks](test.md#2-coordinator-go).
Documentation-impact checks also cover the contact-export and legacy-cohort
store owners; see the [soft-delete reference](../reference/soft-delete.md#documentation-coverage).

The [idle-provider routing regressions](test.md#idle-provider-routing-recovery)
run without a Swift provider binary or downloaded model. Use those focused
checks before `make coordinator-test` when changing exploration or rate ranking.

```bash
make coordinator-build            # cd coordinator && go build ./cmd/coordinator
make coordinator-build-linux      # GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 → coordinator/coordinator-linux
```

The host build writes `./coordinator/coordinator`. Version identity is injected
only by the container build (`-ldflags -X …api.BuildVersion/BuildCommit/BuildDate`
in `coordinator/Dockerfile`); a local `go build` reports `dev`/`unknown` on
`GET /health` (`coordinator/api/inference/consumer.go`, `HandleHealth`).

### 4. Prompt-contract sidecar (Rust)

```bash
make prompt-sidecar-format   # cargo fmt --all -- --check
make prompt-sidecar-check    # cargo check --locked --all-targets; cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
make prompt-sidecar-build    # cargo build --locked --release --bin promptsidecar
make prompt-sidecar          # format + check + test + build
```

Output: `./coordinator/promptsidecar/target/release/promptsidecar`. The
coordinator container needs a **statically linked Linux binary**, built the way
`coordinator/Dockerfile` does it (stage `prompt-sidecar-builder`):

```bash
cd coordinator/promptsidecar
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --locked --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --bin promptsidecar
file target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/promptsidecar   # must say "statically linked" or "static-pie linked"
```

On macOS cross-compiling to musl needs a Linux linker; use the Docker build in
step 9 instead. `scripts/verify-prompt-sidecar-linux.sh <binary>` runs the
production prompt vectors against a Linux sidecar binary (CI job "Prompt
Sidecar Tests").

### 5. Provider CLI (Swift) with source-matched metallib

Build the test product again after changing fixture helpers or assertions;
`--skip-build` alone reuses the previous executable. The
[provider test procedure](test.md#4-provider-swift--unit-tests-with-a-source-matched-metallib)
covers isolated CLI configuration, artifact integrity, SSD authentication,
paged-preflight diagnostics, and stream ordering. Synthetic MLX fixtures need
the matched metallib; enabled live-model fixtures also need their documented
model inputs.

To compile all test targets without executing fixtures:

```bash
(cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests)
```

The test products include the provider/standalone lifecycle, CLI/service/fan,
SSD-cache and benchmark harness groups described in the
[provider test-group map](test.md#provider-lifecycle-cli-and-benchmark-groups).
Most use scripted dependencies and isolated files; the generated tiny-model
load tests execute actual MLX kernels without downloading a checkpoint. A
successful compile alone does not run either group, and neither substitutes
for full-checkpoint qualification. Stage the matched metallib before execution
and use the runner's serial/fresh-process isolation rather than parallelizing
tests that share MLX or model-cache state.

For coverage, the provider CI lane builds tests and the fan-helper product with
`--enable-code-coverage`; its cache key distinguishes instrumented builds from
the SDK and parity lanes (`.github/actions/provider-ci-build/action.yml`). Follow
the [isolated local coverage recipe](test.md#provider-coverage-report-only) for
fresh profiles, state paths, all reported executable objects and retained test
exit status. Product, CLI and benchmark rows are report-only, not a release or
performance gate. Keep these instrumented debug products separate from the
optimized binaries used for performance measurements.

```bash
make provider-build
# = cd provider-swift && swift build
#   ./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh "$(cd provider-swift && swift build --show-bin-path)"
```

`swift build` produces `./provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom` (plus
`darkbloom-enclave`, `darkbloom-fan-helper`, `darkbloom-publish`). MLX loads
`mlx.metallib` from **beside the running executable**, and SwiftPM does not
compile the Metal kernels, so [`scripts/fetch-metallib.sh`](../../scripts/fetch-metallib.sh)
builds them with cmake from `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx` (the exact source
the host side links) and copies the result next to the binary. Despite its
name it builds, it does not download.

MLX also embeds shader source in Cmlx for runtime compilation. After changing
an MLX kernel header, regenerate the affected embedded sources with
`libs/mlx-swift/Tools/update-mlx.sh` from a clean, isolated `libs/mlx-swift`
checkout and review its generated diff. For `quantized.h`, keep both
`Source/Cmlx/mlx-generated/quantized.cpp` and
`Source/Cmlx/mlx-generated/metal/quantized.h` synchronized with the core header.
Rebuild Cmlx and relink the provider as well as rebuilding `mlx.metallib`;
replacing the Metal library alone leaves the embedded QMV implementation intact.
Run the [bias-accumulation regression](test.md#quantized-bias-accumulation-regression)
against the resulting runtime.

```bash
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh            # next to the latest debug build
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh release    # next to the release build
./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh /some/dir  # → /some/dir/mlx.metallib
```

Knobs: `METALLIB_CACHE_DIR` (default `/tmp/mlx-metallib-cache`; cache key
includes the MLX tree SHA, toolchain hash and deployment target) and
`MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` (default `26.2`; the `_nax` kernels are only
compiled at SDK/deployment target ≥ 26.2). The script fails if required kernel
symbols (`_nax`, `gemv`, the `affine_qmv_wide_*` variants) are missing from the
produced library.

After changing doctor subprocess capture or status canonicalization, rebuild
the Swift test targets with `cd provider-swift && swift build --build-tests`.
Then run the [focused capture and canonical-byte regressions](test.md#doctor-capture-and-attestation-canonical-bytes).

#### Instrumented candidate benchmarks

Build `radix-engine` with its matching native dependency and `RADIX_CANDIDATE`
define to emit schema-3 actual-forward-width evidence. The scalar observer and
benchmark validator must come from the same reviewed source cut. See the
[prefix-cache benchmark checks](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation) for
scope, completion and B2/B4 acceptance requirements.
The executable's `scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.resolved` is tracked
and pins the reviewed provider dependency set. Keep locked resolution enabled
and verify the resulting source graph when applying local package overrides.

#### Restored SwiftPM runtime resources

The Provider Tests job removes restored metallibs and resource bundles from
all macOS build configurations in both package caches before building its debug
test product (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). An inactive package's cached debug
bundle can contain older source just as a release bundle can. Each subsequent
package build recreates its own resources; compiled objects and dependency
checkouts remain cached. Runtime lookup accepts byte-identical copies and
continues to reject divergent copies.

The separate [signing-validation workflow](../operations/provider-release.md#environment-free-signing-validation)
checks packaging and Apple signing without selecting a deployment environment.

Release configuration, as the release workflow builds it:

```bash
cd provider-swift && swift build -c release --product darkbloom
swift build -c release --product darkbloom-fan-helper
cd .. && ./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh release
```

`darkbloom --version` must print the value of `ProviderCore.version`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift`);
`scripts/check-release-version.sh` enforces this against the coordinator's
`LatestProviderVersion` (see [../operations/provider-release.md](../operations/provider-release.md)).

For a signed provider bundle needed by isolated tests, use the
[validation-only signing workflow](../operations/provider-release.md#signed-validation-bundle).
It retains an Actions artifact after the normal signing and final-bundle checks.

#### Standalone attention operator replay

[`scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay`](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay/Package.swift)
links only MLX and MLXLMCommon. It consumes validated packet bytes without loading
a model or provider. Use an isolated build directory and the reviewed dependency
pins/local MLX package binding from the replay validation manifest:

```bash
REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/pinned-worktree
ATTENTION_REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT="$REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT" \
  swift build --package-path "$REPLAY_SOURCE_ROOT/scripts/benchmarks/attention-replay" \
    --scratch-path /absolute/path/to/replay-build \
    -c release --product attention-replay --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Retain the executable SHA-256, source/dependency inventory, build graph,
`mlx.metallib` and SwiftPM resource bundles. An executable hash alone does not
bind external Metal resources. The Python driver never builds or downloads them.
Use the [offline NumPy environment](#offline-attention-analysis-environment) for
packet validation and the independent reference. See [replay validation](test.md#attention-operator-replay)
and the [source/test milestone](../reports/2026-09-06-attention-operator-replay.md).

#### Segmented metadata profiler

Build the native `BenchSegmentedDecode` target in an isolated directory with the
same pinned local MLX dependency used by the nested native tests:

```bash
swift build --package-path libs/mlx-swift-lm --scratch-path /absolute/path/to/segment-profiler-build \
  -c release --product BenchSegmentedDecode --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Stage the matching `mlx.metallib` and SwiftPM resource bundles beside the binary,
and retain their hashes with the build's source/dependency inventory. See
[profiler validation](test.md#segmented-metadata-profiler) for the bounded run.

<a id="resident-prefix-benchmark-executable"></a>

#### Prefix-cache benchmark executable

[`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine`](../../scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.swift)
links the real provider factory and MLX packages from an explicitly selected
worktree. Keep baseline and candidate source worktrees separate, with recursive
submodules pinned. From the repository root:

```bash
RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/pinned-worktree
cp "$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE/provider-swift/Package.resolved" scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine/Package.resolved
RADIX_SOURCE_ROOT="$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE" RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=0 \
  swift build --package-path scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine \
    --scratch-path "$RADIX_BENCH_SOURCE/provider-swift/.build" \
    -c release --product radix-engine --jobs 4 --disable-automatic-resolution
```

Use `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` for a source tree containing
`EngineV2Factory.makeBenchmarkSession` and the current cache APIs. The same
harness source compiles against the older baseline with `0`. Candidate SSD mode
uses the normal slot factory after a fresh pre/post-load weight-hash check;
`--cache-mode resident` explicitly reproduces the earlier resident-cache arm.
The baseline conditional and resident reproduction use the direct production
engine factory (`BenchmarkLoader.swift`).

The candidate also accepts `--mtp-acceptance exact|typical` after its positional
arguments; historical baseline builds reject an explicit flag. Omission keeps
`exact`. Rebuild against the provider SPI that exposes
`EngineV2Factory.makeBenchmarkSession(mtpAcceptanceConfig:)`, a `String` argument
defaulting to `"exact"`, in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkSessionConstruction.swift`.
The candidate SSD route forwards the flag through that normal slot factory;
the resident reproduction sets `CBv2MTPConfig.acceptance` directly. Neither route
changes model/assistant verification or memory gates. The flag does not enable
MTP and offers no delta override. See [sampled acceptance validation](test.md#sampled-mtp-acceptance-controls).

The paired persistent-test namespace/access-group options require a candidate
build containing `SSDPersistentTestKeyNamespace`; historical builds reject them.
The same `RADIX_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1` define also enables the namespace test target.
Building this source does not authorize a Keychain group or establish persistent
restart. See [isolated persistent namespace validation](test.md#isolated-persistent-test-namespace).

Archive the source manifest, compile define, binary hash, matching
`mlx.metallib`, and SwiftPM resource bundles before changing that source tree.
Stage the Metal library beside `radix-engine`, as for the provider CLI. Before
model loading, the candidate SSD harness calls `bindRuntimeMetallibForMLX`, the
normal startup binder, and requires a valid immutable digest; placing the file
beside the binary alone does not establish the identity used by the complete
cache (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/BinaryHasher.swift`). The
benchmark session is exposed only through `@_spi(Benchmarking)`; its raw events
preserve token IDs. Segmented storage uses the shared native process owner;
bridge dispatch, contiguous bridge admission and HTTP framing require the
separate provider HTTP probe. See [cache validation](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
for replay, key-mode and process-restart requirements.

The current candidate accepts `--concurrency 1|2|4` and either
`--production-kv-grant` or `--kv-budget-gib N` after its positional arguments.
Archive one binary for all compared arms. Use `--production-kv-grant` for the
single-model production-capacity run: the existing slot session derives its
logical grant from loaded target and assistant weights using the
[production grant policy](../architecture/hardware-support.md#kv-slot-grants).
Archive the Python evaluator source with the binary evidence as well: the
schema-2 cache comparator requires an off-to-on pair and validates idle/shutdown
ownership. A binary whose terminal snapshots precede publication of retired
engine gauges cannot satisfy that idle gate; preserve the raw refusal and use
a harness with coherent observations for the final comparison
(`scripts/benchmarks/radix_engine_evidence.py`, `retirement_errors`).
The current candidate includes bounded observation of published idle snapshots.
Its pure `BenchmarkIdleObservationTests` target can be run with `swift test`
using the same package, pinned source environment and scratch path as the build.
Keep test and release artifacts distinct, and use the final release binary for
both compared arms. Preserve logs that name the executed Swift Testing cases;
an XCTest runner may report zero tests before Swift Testing executes its suite.
It retains the separate post-build live OS/activation headroom gate.
The mode requires the candidate SSD serving path; it cannot be combined with
resident reproduction, native-probe-only mode or an explicit grant
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Factory/EngineV2Factory+BenchmarkGrant.swift`,
`benchmarkProductionGrant`; `BenchmarkOptions.swift`).

For explicit envelope controls, use `--kv-budget-gib N`. Without either flag,
the existing default remains one request and a 16 GiB explicit slot grant.
Explicit mode retains its measured post-load allocator guard; that diagnostic
does not size a production grant. Candidate `paged_storage` metrics separately
report committed backing and the mutable logical grant. Follow the
[validation steps](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation) to retain policy
inputs, live headroom and actual engine capacity with each result.

For a bounded target diagnostic, append `--native-kv-probe-only` with
`cache-off mtp-off` and concurrency one. This candidate-only mode loads the
verified model and runs the same native KV type probe used before paged backend
construction: two prefill tokens followed by one decode token. It records each
attention row's actual K/V types and shapes, with model and metallib hashes.
It creates no serving engine or SSD store.

The standalone product also includes optional bounded target-logit capture through
`--logit-diagnostic-position` and `--logit-diagnostic-candidates`. Build it with the
matching native submodule; follow the [diagnostic procedure](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
to preserve the original request and compare observation against an uninstrumented
control. These flags belong to the standalone benchmark, not the provider CLI.

The matching native submodule also supports `--attention-packet-position` and
`--attention-packet-layer` for a bounded native-byte capture from one attention
owner. Follow the [capture procedure](test.md#prefix-cache-benchmark-validation)
before passing the exported packet to the offline analyzer below.

#### Offline attention analysis environment

The optional [attention packet analyzer](../../scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/FORMAT.md)
uses a separate Python environment and the pinned NumPy requirement. It needs
no Swift build, model weights or GPU.

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv
/tmp/darkbloom-attention-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r scripts/benchmarks/attention_packet/requirements.txt
```

Use that interpreter for [packet analysis and its tests](test.md#offline-attention-packet-analysis).

### 6. Console UI (Next.js)

```bash
make ui-install   # cd console-ui && npm install
make ui-lint      # npx eslint src/
make ui-test      # npm test  (vitest run)
make ui-build     # npm run build  (next build)
make ui           # install + lint + test + build
```

Local dev server: `cd console-ui && npm run dev`. Bundle budget check:
`npm run bundle:check` (`console-ui/scripts/analyze-bundle.mjs`). CI uses
`npm ci`.

### 7. Admin UI (Next.js)

No `make` target. From `admin-ui/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint     # eslint src/
npm test         # vitest run
npm run build    # next build
npm run dev      # next dev -p 4001
```

### 8. Landing page

The imported Next.js site lives in `landing/` and has its own npm
lockfile and configuration. It does not depend on the eigen-homepages
workspace. From the repository root:

```bash
make landing
cd landing && npm run dev
```

Copy `landing/.env.example` to `.env.local` inside that directory to
configure runtime integrations. A production build needs no credentials.
The hosting root is `landing`, with the Next.js preset; its API routes
require a server runtime rather than a static export. See the
[marketing README](../../landing/README.md) for deployment handoff.

### 9. Coordinator container image

Run `python3 scripts/check-go-toolchain.py` before building. Release Integrity
runs the same guard and its regression suite: `mise.toml` and the digest-pinned
Go builder must declare the same exact patch version, at least the `go.mod`
minimum. Do not downgrade dependencies or rely on automatic toolchain downloads
to compensate for an older builder. The guard checks declarations, not registry
contents; verify the image digest and platform when updating its tag.

The production image is built by [`coordinator/Dockerfile`](../../coordinator/Dockerfile)
from the **repo root** (it copies both `coordinator/` and the sidecar crate):

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION="$(awk -F'"' '/public static let version =/ {print $2}' provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -f coordinator/Dockerfile -t coordinator:local .
```

Stages: `prompt-sidecar-builder` (`rust:1.88.0-alpine`, musl static build) →
`builder` (`golang:1.26.8-alpine`, `-ldflags` version injection) → final image
`FROM eigengajesh/d-inference-base:v1-amd64` with `/usr/local/bin/coordinator`
and `/usr/local/bin/promptsidecar`, OCI labels
`org.opencontainers.image.{version,revision,created}`, `EXPOSE 8080`, entrypoint
`start.sh` (`coordinator/deploy/start.sh`). Cloud Build wraps exactly this in
`deploy/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml` (dev) and `deploy/gcp/cloudbuild-prod.yaml`
(prod); see [`../operations/coordinator-deploy.md`](../operations/coordinator-deploy.md).

### 10. Use the database-only coordinator command

The normal coordinator build also supports `coordinator --migrate-only`. It
requires `EIGENINFERENCE_DATABASE_URL`, validates store configuration rather than
full application/serving prerequisites, and exits without starting the server or
seeding an admin key. `EIGENINFERENCE_MIGRATION_TIMEOUT` bounds the full command;
`EIGENINFERENCE_CONCURRENT_INDEX_LOCK_TIMEOUT` independently bounds concurrent
build lock waits (see [configuration](../reference/configuration.md#database-store-and-persistent-disk)).
Container execution must override
the default MicroMDM entrypoint script; see the
[schema migration runbook](../operations/schema-migration.md#4-apply-the-migrations).

The [startup measurement tool](../operations/coordinator-startup-measurement.md)
requires Python 3.10+ and no third-party packages or build step. Its tests use
local stub servers; its default observation mode sends only public GETs.

## Git hooks

Enable once with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Both hooks only act on
components that changed.

| Hook | Trigger | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| [`.githooks/pre-commit`](../../.githooks/pre-commit) | staged `coordinator/**.go` | `gofmt -l` on the staged files (fix: `gofmt -w <file>`) |
| | staged `console-ui/**.ts{,x}` | `cd console-ui && npx eslint src/` (fix: `npx eslint --fix src/`) |
| | Swift | skipped — no enforced formatter |
| [`.githooks/pre-push`](../../.githooks/pre-push) | any `coordinator/` change in the pushed range | `gofmt -l .` over `coordinator/`, then `go test ./coordinator/...` from the repository root: ordinary discovery includes every mirrored package and production package, with no package exclusion. Use `make coordinator-test` for runner guards, isolated shards and production coverage |
| | any `console-ui/` change | `npx eslint --quiet src/` and `npm run build` |

CI runs the fuller set (`gofmt`, `golangci-lint`, `-race` tests, Swift, Rust,
docs lint); see [test.md](test.md).

## Verify

```bash
make build
ls -l coordinator/coordinator coordinator/promptsidecar/target/release/promptsidecar
ls -l provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom provider-swift/.build/debug/mlx.metallib
./provider-swift/.build/debug/darkbloom --version    # prints ProviderCore.version, e.g. 0.8.16
ls console-ui/.next
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `swift build` cannot resolve `../libs/mlx-swift` | submodules not checked out | `git submodule update --init --recursive` |
| provider starts but MLX fails to load kernels / "metallib not found" | `mlx.metallib` missing beside the binary | `./scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` (or `make provider-build`) |
| `fetch-metallib.sh` fails on missing `_nax` symbols | deployment target/SDK below 26.2 | update Xcode; or set `MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` only if you accept a kernel set that differs from release builds |
| `cargo build --locked` fails on lockfile | `Cargo.lock` out of date with `Cargo.toml` | run `cargo update -p <crate>` deliberately and commit the lock; never drop `--locked` in CI |
| `go build` picks a different Go | `mise` not activated in this shell | `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (or zsh) then retry |
| `docker build` fails at `file … statically linked` | sidecar not statically linked (musl target missing) | the Dockerfile adds the target itself; check Docker platform is `linux/amd64` |

## App Attest release qualification

Use the macOS 27 SDK for a candidate that needs Apple code-measurement extensions. The release workflow explicitly selects Command Line Tools 27.0 / Swift 6.4, then runs provider tests under that same SDK; ordinary development retains the Swift 6.3 minimum. Set `SDKROOT` to that SDK for both compilation and linking: a CLT 27 beta 6 Swift probe compiled with `--sdk` alone embedded the deployment target as its SDK; setting `SDKROOT` produced the correct linked SDK. Verify `LC_BUILD_VERSION` with `xcrun vtool -show-build` on the final executable. Confirm the final signed executable produces the current launch category and full CodeDirectory digest on physical macOS 27; SDK 26 builds can collect ordinary shadow proofs but cannot qualify replacement readiness. See the [observed SDK and measurement contract](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#macos-sdk-and-signed-code-measurements).

Run `go test ./tests/appattest/... ./tests/api/... ./tests/store/... -run 'TestAppAttest|TestAuthorization|TestApple|TestMacCodeMeasurement'`
from `coordinator/`, using a disposable local `DATABASE_URL` for the store
contracts (the test harness truncates tables). Add `-race` for concurrency checks.
Run `swift test --filter ProviderAppAttestTests` from `provider-swift/`.
The private admin queries have PostgreSQL coverage in
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest.test.ts` and
`admin-ui/src/lib/queries/app-attest-diagnostics.test.ts`.

After the optimized provider is packaged with its resources, run
`DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL=18 MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT=1 MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES=1 Darkbloom.app/Contents/MacOS/darkbloom runtime-smoke`
(the child validates retained latches that MLX reads at its first Metal touch,
so the caller seeds them, exactly as `SelfUpdater` and `install.sh` do). Require all four markers:
`app-attest-callback-runtime-smoke: ok`, `gemma-optimizations-runtime-smoke: ok`,
`paged-kernel-runtime-smoke: ok`, and `qwen4-metal-resources-runtime-smoke: ok`. The first line is
`build-environment-runtime-smoke: <prod|dev> coordinator=<url> cdn=<url>`. The release workflow
requires `<prod|dev>` to match the release environment. Callback completion and expiry are exercised
without Apple service calls or a Keychain item. This linked-binary check catches
a release-only allocator failure that debug tests missed. Run
`bash scripts/test-install-atomic.sh` for installer acceptance and rollback cases.
The [rollout runbook](../operations/app-attest-rollout.md) separates these checks
from real Apple receipt renewal and final signed-artifact fleet qualification.

Candidate native prefix-cache benchmarks must build ProviderCore and
`scripts/benchmarks/radix-engine` from the same source revision: the benchmark
prompt SPI carries production sampling parameters into each engine request.
See [native benchmark validation](test.md#resident-prefix-benchmark-validation)
for sampling scope, regression filters and diagnostic restrictions.

### Qwen packaged resource regression

`python3 scripts/test-qwen4-packaged-resources.py` compiles the actual Qwen Metal resource accessor into a small optimized app, then runs it from a relocated app and an installer-style executable symlink. It checks all three preamble hashes, rejects missing or empty files and resource links outside the app, and proves that developer/cwd copies cannot mask a broken packaged resource. It needs Swift on macOS, but no model weights or GPU. Both SDK 27 release lanes and Provider Tests run this check. The full provider `runtime-smoke` exercises the same accessor before publication, installation, and update.

Provider Tests also runs `python3 scripts/test-profile-inventory-auth.py` on macOS. It compiles the production `ProfileInventoryAuthorization` helper into a terminal fixture without invoking real `sudo` or changing profiles; the test procedure is in [test.md](test.md).

## Promotion payload helper

`python3 scripts/model-token-promotion.py --help` prepares a model-specific, calendar-day grant payload without making API calls. It requires Python with `zoneinfo` and timezone data. The [promotion runbook](../operations/model-token-promotions.md) covers review and approved application; the [test guide](test.md) covers calendar and settlement validation.

## Source-matched test libraries

After `swift build --build-tests`, run `scripts/stage-test-metallib.sh` with the
package's `swift build --show-bin-path` directory. The helper builds or verifies
the matching MLX library. Then it copies the library into every `*.xctest`
bundle in that directory: beside the test executable and in the nested resource
bundle that native checkpoint identity tests use. The native build system makes
one `<Package>PackageTests.xctest`. CI uses the native build system through
`scripts/provider-release-swift.sh`. A local Swift 6.4 `swift build` uses Swift
Build, which makes one `<Target>.xctest` for each test target. `make provider-test`
and the provider/nested CI jobs invoke this helper. A missing test runner or
failed source verification is an error; an existing library is always replaced.
Use `scripts/run-provider-tests.sh` after staging rather than replacing it with
one unfiltered test process. Its mandatory CPU checkpoint gates own fresh MLX
compile-cache history; the [test guide](test.md) describes their exact byte/state
checks and process-isolation controls.
Live complete-checkpoint tests must also call `bindRuntimeMetallibForMLX`
before their first MLX diagnostic or model load. Colocation alone does not
establish the runtime digest required by the cache identity. The model-prefix
fixture performs this binding explicitly; see
[model prefix qualification](test.md#model-prefix-latency-and-throughput-qualification-live).
Required demanded-checkpoint continuation CI uses the same staged SDK test
image and `scripts/run-nested-suite.sh` as the existing native-retention and
short-partition gates. Its seven scheduler/tiny-fixture methods must execute without optional
model/GPU gates and with the wrapper's nonempty/no-skip checks. The provider's
four adjacent-fork host methods are built with the ordinary ProviderCoreTests
suite; eight independent pure collator controls remain distinct qualification
evidence. A filtered suite's exit code alone does not certify execution. New
same-donor adjacent native runs require a newly frozen source/binary/spec cut;
prior four-role benchmark reports cannot qualify the added frontier. See
[the model-prefix test contract](test.md#model-prefix-latency-and-throughput-qualification-live).

Staging prefers `cp -c` on Darwin to retain APFS cloning, falling back to ordinary
`cp` if cloning fails or is unsupported. Other hosts, including Linux fixture
runners, use ordinary `cp` directly. Copy or byte-verification failures leave
the destination unchanged; verified copies replace it atomically.
See [the live-test setup](test.md) for the pinned DiffusionGemma artifact and
opt-in encrypted transport gate.

## Advisory review tooling

The [threat-model PR review](threat-model-review.md) uses Python 3.9+ standard-library
HTTP/JSON modules and requires no package installation. CI runs its regression
tests against local HTTP fixtures; the live workflow uses a repository Actions
secret and the trusted base checkout. Full PR scans read immutable Git blobs as
data and batch complete changed-file text; they never build or execute PR code.
Set the activation variable before merge after verifying the state writer with
the manual, zero-spend `preflight` option. Repositories that restrict branch
updates can configure a dedicated App writer with short-lived tokens.
Sonnet 5.5 handles the first pass; selected Opus 5.5 and GPT-6.1 Sol reviews use
the same OpenRouter key. Atomic budget reservations, cached analysis and durable
reports live on a dedicated state branch. Paid scanning defaults to disabled;
follow the linked setup instructions to verify writer permissions and pilot caps.

## Stripe migration maintenance

Build the audit/repair binary with `go build -o /tmp/payout-audit ./coordinator/cmd/payout-audit`.
It uses the configured database without running migrations and defaults to read-only
bounded output. Applying a refund requires an exact withdrawal ID, expected amount
and an operator-verified Stripe request. See [the cutover runbook](../operations/stripe-migration.md).

Exercise the API, funding and settlement contracts with
`go test ./coordinator/tests/api/... ./coordinator/tests/billing/... ./coordinator/tests/store/... ./coordinator/tests/cmd/payout-audit`.
Set `DATABASE_URL` to a disposable local PostgreSQL database to run transaction,
concurrency and rollback coverage. Never point tests at production. Console
migration coverage runs with `npm test` in `console-ui`.

## Telemetry archive worker

The independent Python worker uses `scripts/telemetry_archive/Dockerfile` and hash-pinned `requirements.lock`. Run `uv sync --locked` in that directory for local tooling; build the container for Linux/amd64. It does not rebuild or deploy the coordinator. The same worker supports isolated accounting archives and indexed ID batches; deploy each archive job with its own destination permissions. See [telemetry history](../operations/telemetry-history.md) and [accounting history](../operations/accounting-history.md).

`telemetry-archive analytics-preview` compiles catalog-pinned accounting analytics SQL locally; `--execute` runs capped SELECT-only BigQuery checks. `query-submit`, `query-status` and `query-cancel` provide bounded asynchronous custom queries; see [query operations](../operations/history-queries.md). These commands require no coordinator build or deploy. The [operational/history design](../design/operational-history-retention.md) defines the broader storage boundary.

The opt-in analytics reader is built with the coordinator; its private `sync-analytics-snapshot` adapter is part of the Python worker. Neither command enables a producer or schedule. See [analytics snapshots](../operations/analytics-snapshots.md).
